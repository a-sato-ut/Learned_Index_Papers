  "title": "Online bipartite matching with imperfect advice",
  "abstract": "We study the problem of online unweighted bipartite matching with $n$ offline vertices and $n$ online vertices where one wishes to be competitive against the optimal offline algorithm. While the classic RANKING algorithm of Karp et al. [1990] provably attains competitive ratio of $1-1/e>1/2$, we show that no learning-augmented method can be both 1-consistent and strictly better than $1/2$-robust under the adversarial arrival model. Meanwhile, under the random arrival model, we show how one can utilize methods from distribution testing to design an algorithm that takes in external advice about the online vertices and provably achieves competitive ratio interpolating between any ratio attainable by advice-free methods and the optimal ratio of 1, depending on the advice quality.",
  "tldr": "This paper explores online bipartite matching with imperfect advice, demonstrating that while traditional methods achieve a competitive ratio above 1/2, no learning-enhanced approach can exceed this under adversarial conditions. However, with random arrivals, the authors propose an algorithm leveraging external advice that can achieve competitive ratios between advice-free methods and the optimal ratio of 1, depending on the advice's quality."
