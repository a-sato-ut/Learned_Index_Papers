  "title": "A Survey on Techniques for Indexing and Hashing in Big Data",
  "abstract": "Conventional indexing and hashing solutions become ineffective to provide efficient storage and fast retrieval for Big Data due to challenging characteristics of Big Data. Thus, an effective method for Big Data indexing and hashing is required with optimized construction time, storage space, training time, query response time and query result accuracy. Existing Big Data indexing techniques are categorized as Non-Artificial Intelligent, Artificial Intelligent and Collaborative Artificial Intelligent indexing whereas Big Data hashing techniques are categorized as non-deterministic and deterministic hashing. This paper provides an extensive survey on widely used Big Data indexing and hashing techniques along with their parametric comparisons based upon various identified parameters",
  "tldr": "この論文は、ビッグデータにおける効率的なインデックス作成とハッシュ技術の必要性を論じ、既存の手法を非人工知能、人工知能、協調人工知能に分類し、またハッシュ技術を非決定論的と決定論的に分類した広範な調査を提供しています。"
