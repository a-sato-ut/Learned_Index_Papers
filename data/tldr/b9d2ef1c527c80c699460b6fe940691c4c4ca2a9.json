  "title": "In-Memory Indexed Caching for Distributed Data Processing",
  "abstract": "Powerful abstractions such as dataframes are only as efficient as their underlying runtime system. The de-facto distributed data processing framework, Apache Spark, is poorly suited for the modern cloud-based data-science workloads due to its outdated assumptions: static datasets analyzed using coarse-grained transformations. In this paper, we introduce the Indexed DataFrame, an in-memory cache that supports a dataframe abstraction which incorporates indexing capabilities to support fast lookup and join operations. Moreover, it supports appends with multi-version concurrency control. We implement the Indexed DataFrame as a lightweight, standalone library which can be integrated with minimum effort in existing Spark programs. We analyze the performance of the Indexed DataFrame in cluster and cloud deployments with real-world datasets and benchmarks using both Apache Spark and Databricks Runtime. In our evaluation, we show that the Indexed DataFrame significantly speeds-up query execution when compared to a non-indexed dataframe, incurring modest memory overhead.",
  "tldr": "This paper presents the Indexed DataFrame, an in-memory caching solution that enhances Apache Spark's data processing by adding indexing for faster lookups and joins, along with multi-version concurrency control. It demonstrates significant performance improvements with minimal memory overhead."
