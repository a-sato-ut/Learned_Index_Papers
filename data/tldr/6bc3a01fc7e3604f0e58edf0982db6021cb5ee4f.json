  "title": "BT-Tree: A Reinforcement Learning Based Index for Big Trajectory Data",
  "abstract": "With the increasing availability of trajectory data, it is important to have good indexes to facilitate query processing. In this work, we propose BT-Tree, which is built through a recursive bi-partitioning approach, for the processing of range and KNN queries for past trajectory data. We first propose a cost function based method (CFBM) to build the BT-Tree. Specifically, we design a novel cost function, which incorporates the characteristics of both the data and historical query workload, to decide how to partition a BT-Tree node. Then we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) based method to address CFBM's limitations, such as making locally optimal decisions that may lead to global suboptimality. Experiments on three real datasets with up to 800 million data points show that the CFBM generally outperforms the baselines in terms of query processing time and the RL based method consistently outperforms the baselines and has more significant advantages on larger datasets.",
  "tldr": "BT-Tree is a novel index for processing range and KNN queries on large trajectory datasets, utilizing a cost function-based method and reinforcement learning to optimize partitioning, demonstrating superior performance in query processing time, especially on larger datasets."
