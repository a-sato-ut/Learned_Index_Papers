  "title": "Benchmarking learned indexes",
  "abstract": "Recent advancements in learned index structures propose replacing existing index structures, like B-Trees, with approximate learned models. In this work, we present a unified benchmark that compares well-tuned implementations of three learned index structures against several state-of-the-art \"traditional\" baselines. Using four real-world datasets, we demonstrate that learned index structures can indeed outperform non-learned indexes in read-only in-memory workloads over a dense array. We investigate the impact of caching, pipelining, dataset size, and key size. We study the performance profile of learned index structures, and build an explanation for why learned models achieve such good performance. Finally, we investigate other important properties of learned index structures, such as their performance in multi-threaded systems and their build times.",
  "tldr": "This study benchmarks three learned index structures against traditional indexes, revealing that learned models outperform them in read-only in-memory workloads. It explores factors like caching and dataset size, while also assessing performance in multi-threaded environments and build times."
