  "title": "Are Updatable Learned Indexes Ready?",
  "abstract": "Recently, numerous promising results have shown that updatable learned indexes can perform better than traditional indexes with much lower memory space consumption. But it is unknown how these learned indexes compare against each other and against the traditional ones under realistic workloads with changing data distributions and concurrency levels. This makes practitioners still wary about how these new indexes would actually behave in practice. To fill this gap, this paper conducts the first comprehensive evaluation on updatable learned indexes. Our evaluation uses ten real datasets and various workloads to challenge learned indexes in three aspects: performance, memory space efficiency and robustness. Based on the results, we give a series of takeaways that can guide the future development and deployment of learned indexes.",
  "tldr": "この論文は、アップデート可能な学習インデックスの性能、メモリ効率、堅牢性を現実的なデータ分布と同時実行レベルで評価し、従来のインデックスとの比較を行った初の包括的な研究を提供し、今後の開発と展開に向けた指針を示しています。"
