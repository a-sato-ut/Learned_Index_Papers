  "title": "Learning-Augmented Frequency Estimation in Sliding Windows",
  "abstract": "We show how to utilize machine learning approaches to improve sliding window algorithms for approximate frequency estimation problems, under the “algorithms with predictions” framework. In this dynamic environment, previous learning-augmented algorithms are less effective, since properties in sliding window resolution can differ significantly from the properties of the entire stream. Our focus is on the benefits of predicting and filtering out items with large next arrival times – that is, there is a large gap until their next appearance – from the stream, which we show improves the memory-accuracy tradeoffs significantly. We provide theorems that provide insight into how and by how much our technique can improve the sliding window algorithm, as well as experimental results using real-world data sets. Our work demonstrates that predictors can be useful in the challenging sliding window setting.",
  "tldr": "This paper explores using machine learning to enhance sliding window algorithms for frequency estimation. It highlights the effectiveness of predicting and filtering items with long gaps until their next appearance, improving memory-accuracy tradeoffs, supported by theoretical insights and experimental results."
