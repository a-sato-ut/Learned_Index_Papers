  "title": "A Tutorial on Learned Multi-dimensional Indexes",
  "abstract": "Recently, Machine Learning (ML, for short) has been successfully applied to database indexing. Initial experimentation on Learned Indexes has demonstrated better search performance and lower space requirements than their traditional database counterparts. Numerous attempts have been explored to extend learned indexes to the multi-dimensional space. This makes learned indexes potentially suitable for spatial databases. The goal of this tutorial is to provide up-to-date coverage of learned indexes both in the single and multi-dimensional spaces. The tutorial covers over 25 learned indexes. The tutorial navigates through the space of learned indexes through a taxonomy that helps classify the covered learned indexes both in the single and multi-dimensional spaces.",
