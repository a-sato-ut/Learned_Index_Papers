  "title": "Improving Online Algorithms via ML Predictions",
  "abstract": "In this work we study the problem of using machine-learned predictions to improve performance of online algorithms. We consider two classical problems, ski rental and non-clairvoyant job scheduling, and obtain new online algorithms that use predictions to make their decisions. These algorithms are oblivious to the performance of the predictor, improve with better predictions, but do not degrade much if the predictions are poor.",
  "tldr": "This paper explores enhancing online algorithms using machine-learned predictions, focusing on ski rental and non-clairvoyant job scheduling. The proposed algorithms adapt to prediction quality, improving with accurate forecasts while maintaining resilience against poor predictions."
