  "title": "Self-Adapting Design and Maintenance of Multi-Model Databases",
  "abstract": "Multi-model data is organised in various mutually interlinked formats and models, often with contradictory features. In addition, its structure may change over time, and its size can grow to the extremes of Big Data. In terms of research and practical processing, this creates one of the most complex challenges of effective data management. As it is not humanly possible to handle such a complex task manually, in this vision paper, we focus on the area of automatic management of dynamic multi-model Big Data. We envision a framework capable of accepting different levels of user input and different types of data, queries, changes, and propagation strategies and ensuring the preservation of adequate and efficient data access.",
  "tldr": "This paper proposes a framework for the automatic management of dynamic multi-model Big Data, addressing the complexities of interlinked data formats and evolving structures. It aims to enhance data access efficiency while accommodating diverse user inputs and query types."
