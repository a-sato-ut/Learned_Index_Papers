  "title": "Estimating Cardinalities with Deep Sketches",
  "abstract": "We introduce Deep Sketches, which are compact models of databases that allow us to estimate the result sizes of SQL queries. Deep Sketches are powered by a new deep learning approach to cardinality estimation that can capture correlations between columns, even across tables. Our demonstration allows users to define such sketches on the TPC-H and IMDb datasets, monitor the training process, and run ad-hoc queries against trained sketches. We also estimate query cardinalities with HyPer and PostgreSQL to visualize the gains over traditional cardinality estimators.",
