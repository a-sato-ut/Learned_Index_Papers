  "title": "Piecewise Linear Approximation in Learned Index Structures: Theoretical and Empirical Analysis",
  "abstract": "A growing trend in the database and system communities is to augment conventional index structures, such as B+-trees, with machine learning (ML) models. Among these, error-bounded Piecewise Linear Approximation ($\\epsilon$-PLA) has emerged as a popular choice due to its simplicity and effectiveness. Despite its central role in many learned indexes, the design and analysis of $\\epsilon$-PLA fitting algorithms remain underexplored. In this paper, we revisit $\\epsilon$-PLA from both theoretical and empirical perspectives, with a focus on its application in learned index structures. We first establish a fundamentally improved lower bound of $\\Omega(\\kappa \\cdot \\epsilon^2)$ on the expected segment coverage for existing $\\epsilon$-PLA fitting algorithms, where $\\kappa$ is a data-dependent constant. We then present a comprehensive benchmark of state-of-the-art $\\epsilon$-PLA algorithms when used in different learned data structures. Our results highlight key trade-offs among model accuracy, model size, and query performance, providing actionable guidelines for the principled design of future learned data structures.",
