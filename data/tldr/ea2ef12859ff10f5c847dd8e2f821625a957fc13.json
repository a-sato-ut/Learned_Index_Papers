  "title": "SNARF: A Learning-Enhanced Range Filter",
  "abstract": "We present Sparse Numerical Array-Based Range Filters (SNARF), a learned range filter that efficiently supports range queries for numerical data. SNARF creates a model of the data distribution to map the keys into a bit array which is stored in a compressed form. The model along with the compressed bit array which constitutes SNARF are used to answer membership queries.\n We evaluate SNARF on multiple synthetic and real-world datasets as a stand-alone filter and by integrating it into RocksDB. For range queries, SNARF provides up to 50x better false positive rate than state-of-the-art range filters, such as SuRF and Rosetta, with the same space usage. We also evaluate SNARF in RocksDB as a filter replacement for filtering requests before they access on-disk data structures. For RocksDB, SNARF can improve the execution time of the system up to 10x compared to SuRF and Rosetta for certain read-only workloads.",
  "tldr": "SNARF is a learned range filter that significantly improves range query performance, achieving up to 50x lower false positive rates and up to 10x faster execution times in RocksDB compared to existing filters like SuRF and Rosetta, while using the same amount of space."
