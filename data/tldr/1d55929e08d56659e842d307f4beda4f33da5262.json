  "title": "Uniform Convergence Bounds for Codec Selection",
  "abstract": "We frame the problem of selecting an optimal audio encoding scheme as a supervised learning task. Through uniform convergence theory, we guarantee approximately optimal codec selection while controlling for selection bias. We present rigorous statistical guarantees for the codec selection problem that hold for arbitrary distributions over audio sequences and for arbitrary quality metrics. Our techniques can thus balance sound quality and compression ratio, and use audio samples from the distribution to select a codec that performs well on that particular type of data. The applications of our technique are immense, as it can be used to optimize for quality and bandwidth usage of streaming and other digital media, while significantly outperforming approaches that apply a fixed codec to all data sources.",
