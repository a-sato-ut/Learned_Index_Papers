  "title": "RadixSpline: a single-pass learned index",
  "abstract": "Recent research has shown that learned models can outperform state-of-the-art index structures in size and lookup performance. While this is a very promising result, existing learned structures are often cumbersome to implement and are slow to build. In fact, most approaches that we are aware of require multiple training passes over the data. We introduce RadixSpline (RS), a learned index that can be built in a single pass over the data and is competitive with state-of-the-art learned index models, like RMI, in size and lookup performance. We evaluate RS using the SOSD benchmark and show that it achieves competitive results on all datasets, despite the fact that it only has two parameters.",
  "tldr": "RadixSpline (RS) is a novel learned index that can be built in a single pass over data, offering competitive size and lookup performance compared to existing models like RMI. Evaluated on the SOSD benchmark, RS demonstrates strong results with just two parameters."
