  "title": "Learning Everywhere: Pervasive Machine Learning for Effective High-Performance Computation",
  "abstract": "The convergence of HPC and data intensive methodologies provide a promising approach to major performance improvements. This paper provides a general description of the interaction between traditional HPC and ML approaches and motivates the \"Learning Everywhere\" paradigm for HPC. We introduce the concept of \"effective performance\" that one can achieve by combining learning methodologies with simulation based approaches, and distinguish between traditional performance as measured by benchmark scores. To support the promise of integrating HPC and learning methods, this paper examines specific examples and opportunities across a series of domains. It concludes with a series of open software systems, methods and infrastructure challenges that the Learning Everywhere paradigm presents.",
  "tldr": "This paper advocates for the \"Learning Everywhere\" paradigm, which integrates machine learning with high-performance computing (HPC) to enhance effective performance beyond traditional benchmarks, exploring its applications and challenges across various domains."
