  "title": "Fast Linear Interpolation",
  "abstract": "We present fast implementations of linear interpolation operators for piecewise linear functions and multi-dimensional look-up tables. These operators are common for efficient transformations in image processing and are the core operations needed for lattice models like deep lattice networks, a popular machine learning function class for interpretable, shape-constrained machine learning. We present new strategies for an efficient compiler-based solution using MLIR to accelerate linear interpolation. For real-world machine-learned multi-layer lattice models that use multidimensional linear interpolation, we show these strategies run 5-10× faster on a standard CPU compared to an optimized C++ interpreter implementation.",
  "tldr": "新しいMLIRベースの手法を用いて、線形補間の高速実装を提案し、従来のC++実装と比較して5-10倍の速度向上を実現した。"
