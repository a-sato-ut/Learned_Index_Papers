  "title": "Accelerating long-read analysis on modern CPUs",
  "abstract": "Long read sequencing is now routinely used at scale for genomics and transcriptomics applications. Mapping of long reads or a draft genome assembly to a reference sequence is often one of the most time consuming steps in these applications. Here, we present techniques to accelerate minimap2, a widely used software for mapping. We present multiple optimizations using SIMD parallelization, efficient cache utilization and a learned index data structure to accelerate its three main computational modules, i.e., seeding, chaining and pairwise sequence alignment. These result in reduction of end-to-end mapping time of minimap2 by up to 1.8 × while maintaining identical output.",
  "tldr": "新しい技術を用いて、長読み解析ソフトウェアminimap2の処理速度を最大1.8倍向上させる最適化手法を提案し、出力は同一のままマッピング時間を短縮する。"
