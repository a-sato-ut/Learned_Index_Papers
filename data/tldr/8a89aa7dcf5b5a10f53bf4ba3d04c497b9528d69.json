  "title": "Non-clairvoyant Scheduling with Predictions",
  "abstract": "In the single-machine non-clairvoyant scheduling problem, the goal is to minimize the total completion time of jobs whose processing times are unknown a priori. We revisit this well-studied problem and consider the question of how to effectively use (possibly erroneous) predictions of the processing times. We study this question from ground zero by first asking what constitutes a good prediction; we then propose a new measure to gauge prediction quality and design scheduling algorithms with strong guarantees under this measure. Our approach to derive a prediction error measure based on natural desiderata could find applications for other online problems.",
  "tldr": "This paper explores non-clairvoyant scheduling by examining how to effectively utilize potentially inaccurate predictions of job processing times, proposing a new measure for prediction quality and developing scheduling algorithms with strong performance guarantees based on this measure."
