    "abstract": "The addition of a shaft generator with drive and generation functions gives a hybrid power system complex electromechanical coupling characteristics. The effects of excitation sources may cause unstable behavior in the system. Modelling and simulation can not only recurrent the ship mode transition process, but also lay the foundation for mode transition optimization. According to the power configuration of the inland ship Changhang Cargo 001, the diesel-electric propulsion system is established by a quasi-static approach on Simcenter AMESim software. This model is a guideline for all aspects of research on hybrid power ships, especially hybrid power ships propelled by twin propeller shafts.",
