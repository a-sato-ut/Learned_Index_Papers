    "abstract": "\n This paper presents PathCE, a path-centric cardinality estimation framework for subgraph matching. PathCE improves estimation accuracy by utilizing statistics from short graph queries. At its core is a novel data structure called the\n path-centric summary graph\n (PSG), which captures short path query statistics from a data graph\n G\n and represents them in a new graph\n G\n . Given a graph query\n Q\n and a PSG graph\n G\n for G, PathCE decomposes\n Q\n into a simpler query\n G\n , where each edge in\n G\n corresponds to a sub-path query in\n Q\n with statistics included in\n G\n . PathCE estimates the cardinality using\n G\n and\n G\n , requiring significantly fewer estimation iterations while ensuring that the estimate remains an upper bound on the true cardinality of\n Q\n (\n G\n ). It also includes PSGBuilder, a parallelly scalable algorithm that constructs PSG's for any given graph in linear time, efficiently scaling with the number of processors. Empirical results on real-world and synthetic datasets show that PathCE outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in accuracy, estimation latency, and summary construction efficiency.\n",
