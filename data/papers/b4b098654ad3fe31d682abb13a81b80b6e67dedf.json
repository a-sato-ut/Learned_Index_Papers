    "abstract": "Optimal page replacement is an important problem in efficient buffer management. The range of replacement strategies known in the literature varies from simple but efficient FIFO-based algorithms to more accurate but potentially costly methods tailored to specific data access patterns. The principal issue in adopting a pattern-specific replacement logic in a DB buffer manager is to guarantee non-degradation in general high-load regimes. In this paper, we propose a new family of page replacement algorithms for DB buffer manager which demonstrate a superior performance wrt competitors on custom data access patterns and imply a low computational overhead on TPC-C. We provide theoretical foundations and an extensive experimental study on the proposed algorithms which covers synthetic benchmarks and an implementation in an open-source DB kernel evaluated on TPC-C.",
