    "abstract": "The pressure on the scalability of cloud applications is increasing, and storage performance has become a key bottleneck. A single cache replacement policy is difficult to achieve stable performance in diverse workload scenarios. To further enhance the adaptability of the cache system to complex workloads, this paper proposes an adaptive cache replacement algorithm UMCache based on policy combination. Firstly, it integrates two expert policies, SR-LRU and CR-LFU, to take into account the wide adaptability to several types of loads. Meanwhile, it combines the UCB (Upper Confidence Bound) algorithm and the idea of regret minimization in reinforcement learning to select policies, considering both the utilization rate of the policies and the effective exploration of the policies. In addition, to enhance the feedback ability of the hit state to the mis-ejection of the policy, the Mithril association rule prefetching algorithm is introduced and used as a time-aware feedback layer to participate in the score update of policy selection, achieving more fine-grained feedback. Experimental results show that UMCache outperforms LRU, LFU, ARC, and LeCaR algorithms in multiple real and synthetic workloads.",
