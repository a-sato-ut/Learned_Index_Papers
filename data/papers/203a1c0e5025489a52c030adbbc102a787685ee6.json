    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning provides an automated framework for learning behaviors from high-level reward specifications, but in practice the choice of reward function can be crucial for good results -- while in principle the reward only needs to specify what the task is, in reality practitioners often need to design more detailed rewards that provide the agent with some hints about how the task should be completed. The idea of this type of ``reward-shaping'' has been often discussed in the literature, and is often a critical part of practical applications, but there is relatively little formal characterization of how the choice of reward shaping can yield benefits in sample complexity. In this work, we build on the framework of novelty-based exploration to provide a simple scheme for incorporating shaped rewards into RL along with an analysis tool to show that particular choices of reward shaping provably improve sample efficiency. We characterize the class of problems where these gains are expected to be significant and show how this can be connected to practical algorithms in the literature. We confirm that these results hold in practice in an experimental evaluation, providing an insight into the mechanisms through which reward shaping can significantly improve the complexity of reinforcement learning while retaining asymptotic performance.",
