    "abstract": "Nowadays, Named Data Networking (NDN) has gained significant importance since there is a shift in the Internet paradigm from host-centric model to content-centric model. Modern users are more concerned about what the data is and not about from where the data is coming. Since NDN has to handle huge amount of data every second, the data structures used in NDN should be efficient and scalable. Bloom Filter (BF), an important category of Probabilistic Data Structures (PDS) has shown embarking results in terms of space and time tradeoffs. This work focuses on various implementations of BF in the domain of NDN along with their advantages and limitations.",
