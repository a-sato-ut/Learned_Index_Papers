    "abstract": "Decoupling techniques have been proposed to reduce the amount of memory latency exposed to high-performance accelerators as they fetch data. Although decoupled access-execute (DAE) and more recent decoupled data supply approaches offer promising single-threaded performance improvements, little work has considered how to extend them into parallel scenarios. This article explores the opportunities and challenges of designing parallel, high-performance, resource-efficient decoupled data supply systems. We propose Mercury, a parallel decoupled data supply system that utilizes thread-level parallelism for high-throughput data supply with good portability attributes. Additionally, we introduce some microarchitectural improvements for data supply units to efficiently handle long-latency indirect loads.",
