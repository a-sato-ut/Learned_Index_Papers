    "abstract": "We present a taxonomy of research on Machine Learning (ML) applied to enhance simulations together with a catalog of some activities. We cover eight patterns for the link of ML to the simulations or systems plus three algorithmic areas: particle dynamics, agent-based models and partial differential equations. The patterns are further divided into three action areas: Improving simulation with Configurations and Integration of Data, Learn Structure, Theory and Model for Simulation, and Learn to make Surrogates.",
