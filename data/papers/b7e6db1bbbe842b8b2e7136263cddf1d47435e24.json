    "abstract": "Increasing complexity of modern chips makes design validation more difficult. Existing approaches are not able anymore to cope with the complexity of tasks such as robust performance tuning in post-silicon validation. Therefore, we propose a novel approach based on learn-to-optimize and reinforcement learning in order to solve complex and mixed-type tuning tasks in a efficient and robust way.",
