    "abstract": "We study the Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problem on general graphs within the framework of learning-augmented algorithms. The MIS problem is known to be NP-hard and is also NP-hard to approximate to within a factor of $n^{1-\\delta}$ for any $\\delta>0$. We show that we can break this barrier in the presence of an oracle obtained through predictions from a machine learning model that answers vertex membership queries for a fixed MIS with probability $1/2+\\varepsilon$. In the first setting we consider, the oracle can be queried once per vertex to know if a vertex belongs to a fixed MIS, and the oracle returns the correct answer with probability $1/2 + \\varepsilon$. Under this setting, we show an algorithm that obtains an $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{\\Delta}/\\varepsilon)$-approximation in $O(m)$ time where $\\Delta$ is the maximum degree of the graph. In the second setting, we allow multiple queries to the oracle for a vertex, each of which is correct with probability $1/2 + \\varepsilon$. For this setting, we show an $O(1)$-approximation algorithm using $O(n/\\varepsilon^2)$ total queries and $\\tilde{O}(m)$ runtime.",
