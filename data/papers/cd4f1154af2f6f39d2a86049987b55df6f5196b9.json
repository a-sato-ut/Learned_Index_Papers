    "abstract": "Analyzing flow of objects or data at different granularities of space and time can unveil interesting insights or trends. For example, transportation companies, by aggregating passenger travel data (e.g., counting passengers travelling from one region to another), can analyze movement behavior. In this paper, we study the problem of finding important trends in passenger movements between regions at different granularities. We define Origin (O), Destination (D), and Time (T) patterns (ODT patterns) and propose an algorithm that enumerates them. We propose optimizations that greatly reduce the search space and the computational cost of pattern enumeration. We also propose pattern variants (constrained patterns and top-k patterns) that could be useful to different application scenarios. We evaluate our methods on three real datasets and identify significant ODT flow patterns in them.",
