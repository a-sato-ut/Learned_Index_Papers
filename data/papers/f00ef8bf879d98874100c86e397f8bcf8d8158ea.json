    "abstract": "Recent advances in AI techniques, as well as enabling hardware and infrastructure, have led to the integration of AI across wide-ranging domains and tasks. In particular, AI has been used to handle various types of data (including numerical, textual and image data) and has been adopted in large-scale distributed systems. From a data management perspective, this calls for the harnessing of state-of-the-art AI solutions for data management tasks and systems. aiDM is a full-day workshop that offers a stage for innovative interdisciplinary research that studies the interaction between AI and data management and develops new AI technologies for data-related tasks. This year, aiDM'24 particularly focuses on the transparent exploitation of AI techniques (e.g., using Generative AI frameworks) for data management for enterprise class workloads.",
