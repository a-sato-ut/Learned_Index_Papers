    "abstract": "Deep learning (DL) system research is often impeded by the limited availability and expensive costs of GPUs. In this paper, we introduce GPEmu, a GPU emulator for faster and cheaper prototyping and evaluation of deep learning system research without using real GPUs. GPEmu comes with four novel features: time emulation, memory emulation, distributed system support, and sharing support. We support over 30 DL models and 6 GPU models, the largest scale to date. We demonstrate the power of GPEmu by successfully reproducing the main results of nine recent publications and easily prototyping three new micro-optimizations.",
