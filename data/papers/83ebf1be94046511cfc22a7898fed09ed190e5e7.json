    "abstract": "Data preparation is necessary to ensure data quality in machine learning-based decisions and data-driven systems. A variety of different tools exist to simplify this process. However, there is often a lack of suitable data sets to evaluate and compare existing tools and new research approaches. For this reason, we implemented GouDa, a tool for generating universal data sets. GouDa can be used to create data sets with arbitrary error types at arbitrary error rates. In addition to the data sets with automatically generated errors, ground truth is provided. Thus, GouDa can be used for the extensive analysis and evaluation of data preparation pipelines.",
