    "abstract": "Sequence alignment is an ubiquitous task in genomics analysis whose performance can be affected by the memory-wall on a processor-centric architecture. Processing-in-Memory (PiM) architectures provide a memory system with integrated computing capabilities to alleviate this bottleneck. In this paper, we present a long read optimized version of the Needleman and Wunsch (N&W) algorithm based on PiM devices developed by the UPMEM company. Such memories add 128 computing units to a standard 16GB DIMM. On a server equipped with 20 UPMEM PiMs, our N&W implementation outperforms standard alignment tools by an order of magnitude compared to a traditional multicore server.
