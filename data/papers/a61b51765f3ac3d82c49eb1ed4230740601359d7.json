    "abstract": "This paper studies cost-effective graph cleaning with a single machine. We adopt a rule-based method that may embed machine learning models as predicates in the rules. Graph cleaning with the rules involves rule discovery, error detection and correction. These tasks are both computation-heavy and I/O-intensive as they repeatedly invoke costly graph pattern matching, and produce a large amount of a large volume of intermediate results, among other things. In light of these, no existing single-machine system is able to carry out these tasks even on not-too-large graphs, even using GPUs. Thus we develop MiniClean, a single-machine system for cleaning large graphs. It proposes (1) a workflow that better fits a single machine by pipelining CPU, GPU and I/O operations; (2) memory footprint reduction with bundled processing and data compression; and (3) a multi-mode parallel model for SIMD, pipelined and independent parallelism, and their scheduling to maximize CPU--GPU synergy. Using real-life graphs, we empirically verify that MiniClean outperforms the SOTA single-machine systems by at least 65.34× and multi-machine systems with 32 nodes by at least 8.09×.",
