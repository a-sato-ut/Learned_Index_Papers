    "abstract": "Spatial accelerator is a specialized hardware to provide noticeable performance speedup for tensor computations. It also brings a challenge to map tensor computations on spatial accelerators. Auto-tuning compiler is one of the most promising directions for tensor mapping. However, existing auto-tuning compilers suffer from either numerous invalid and inefficient programs or inaccurate evaluation of incomplete programs, leading to sub-optimal performance.In this paper, we propose Soter, a novel auto-tuning tensor compilation framework for spatial accelerators. The key is to perform exploration in a both valid and efficient program design space and perform optimization according to accurate evaluation of complete programs. First, we design an analytical model to generate a high-quality program design space, which excludes invalid and inefficient programs. Second, we design an automatic program tuner to efficiently explore the program space and avoid evaluating incomplete programs. Finally, we coordinate the model and the tuner to further improve the quality of program space. The program space is identified by the model and is updated during the exploration of tuner. On average, Soter achieves 2.1× to 3.5× speedup over the state-of-the-art tensor compilers. Moreover, Soter shows better scalability for larger-scale tensor computations and spatial architectures.",
