    "abstract": "In this paper, we consider a heavy inner product identification problem, which generalizes the Light Bulb problem ([1]): Given two sets $A \\subset\\{-1,+1\\}^{d}$ and $B \\subset\\{-1,+1\\}^{d}$ with $|A|=|B|=n$, if there are exact k pairs whose inner product passes a certain threshold, i.e., $\\{\\left(a_{1}, b_{1}\\right), \\cdots,\\left(a_{k}, b_{k}\\right)\\} \\subset A \\times B$ such that $\\forall i \\in[k],\\left\\langle a_{i}, b_{i}\\right\\rangle \\geq \\rho \\cdot d$, for a threshold $\\rho \\in(0,1)$, the goal is to identify those k heavy inner products. We provide an algorithm that runs in $O(n^{2 \\omega / 3+o(1)})$ time to find the k inner product pairs that surpass $\\rho \\cdot d$ threshold with high probability, where $\\omega$ is the current matrix multiplication exponent. By solving this problem, our method speed up the training of neural networks with ReLU activation function.",
