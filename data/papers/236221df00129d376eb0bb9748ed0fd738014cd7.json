    "abstract": "Data federation has emerged as a novel database system enabling collaborative queries across mutually distrusted data owners. Federated equi-join, a commonly used operation in data federation, combines relations from distinct data owners while preserving their data privacy. Due to the wide applications of this query, many solutions to federated equi-joins have been proposed. However, it is still challenging for practitioners to choose the most appropriate algorithm due to various reasons, including incomplete evaluation protocols (e.g., lack of evaluating multi-way equi-joins), under-explored performance metric (main memory usage), and absence of a standardized comparison. Motivated by this reason, this paper conducts a comprehensive experimental study and builds a new benchmark, called <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">${\\sf FEJ-Bench}$</tex-math><alternatives><mml:math><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant=\"sans-serif\">FEJ</mml:mi><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant=\"sans-serif\">Bench</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math><inline-graphic xlink:href=\"tong-ieq1-3375028.gif\"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, for federated equi-joins. The experimental study and the benchmark consist of eight state-of-the-art algorithms and five datasets. Our evaluation reveals the query efficiency ranking, its impact factors, and potential research opportunities. Finally, we open-source <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">${\\sf FEJ-Bench}$</tex-math><alternatives><mml:math><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant=\"sans-serif\">FEJ</mml:mi><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant=\"sans-serif\">Bench</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math><inline-graphic xlink:href=\"tong-ieq2-3375028.gif\"/></alternatives></inline-formula> on GitHub, which is the first benchmark for federated equi-joins. Our findings aim to guide researchers and practitioners in deploying federated equi-joins in practice.",
