    "abstract": "Recommender systems embody significant commercial value and represent crucial intellectual property. However, the integrity of these systems is constantly challenged by malicious actors seeking to steal their underlying models. Safeguarding against such threats is paramount to upholding the rights and interests of the model owner. While model watermarking has emerged as a potent defense mechanism in various domains, its direct application to recommender systems remains unexplored and non-trivial. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing Autoregressive Out-of-distribution Watermarking (AOW), a novel technique tailored specifically for recommender systems. Our approach entails selecting an initial item and querying it through the oracle model, followed by the selection of subsequent items with small prediction scores. This iterative process generates a watermark sequence autoregressively, which is then ingrained into the model's memory through training. To assess the efficacy of the watermark, the model is tasked with predicting the subsequent item given a truncated watermark sequence. Through extensive experimentation and analysis, we demonstrate the superior performance and robust properties of AOW. Notably, our watermarking technique exhibits high-confidence extraction capabilities and maintains effectiveness even in the face of distillation and fine-tuning processes.",
