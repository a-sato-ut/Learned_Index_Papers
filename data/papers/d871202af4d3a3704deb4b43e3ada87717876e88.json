    "abstract": "Many scientific data applications show a cyclic oscillating workload that oscillates between read-heavy and write-heavy constantly. This oscillation introduces a challenge for the existing indexing techniques. Indexes, e.g., the B+-tree and the LSM-tree, cannot perform equally well all the time. Conventional adaptive indexing does not solve this issue as it focuses on adapting in one direction. This paper studies how to support oscillating workloads that arise in scientific data applications with adaptive indexes that adapt the underlying index structures in both directions. With the observation that real-world datasets are skewed, the focus is to optimize the index within the hotspot regions. The Adaptive Hotspot-Aware Tree (or AHA-tree, for short) is introduced, where its adaptation is bi-directional. Experimental evaluation shows that AHA-tree can behave competitively as compared to an LSM-tree for write-heavy transactional workloads. Upon switching to a read-heavy analytical workload, AHA-tree can gradually adapt and behave competitively, and can match the B+-tree’s read performance.",
