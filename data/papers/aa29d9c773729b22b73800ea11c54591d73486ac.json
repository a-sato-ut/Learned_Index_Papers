    "abstract": "Quantum computers promise polynomial or exponential speed-up in solving certain problems compared to classical computers. However, in practical use, there are currently a number of fundamental technical challenges. One of them concerns the loading of data into quantum computers, since they cannot access common databases. In this vision paper, we develop a hybrid data management architecture in which databases can serve as data sources for quantum algorithms. To test the architecture, we perform experiments in which we assign data points stored in a database to clusters. For cluster assignment, a quantum algorithm processes this data by determining the distances between data points and cluster centroids.",
