    "abstract": "LSM-tree based key-value (KV) stores organize data in a multi-level structure for high-speed writes. A range query on this structure has to seek and sort-merge data from multiple table files on the fly, which is expensive and often leads to mediocre read performance. To improve range query efficiency on LSM-trees, we introduce a space-efficient KV index data structure, named REMIX, that records a global sorted view of KV data spanning multiple table files. A range query with REMIX on multiple data files can quickly locate the target key using a binary search, and retrieve the subsequent keys in the sorted order without key comparisons. We build RemixDB, an LSM-tree based KV-store that adopts a write-efficient compaction strategy and employs REMIX for fast point and range queries. Experimental results show that REMIX can substantially improve range query performance in a write-optimized LSM-tree based KV-store.",
