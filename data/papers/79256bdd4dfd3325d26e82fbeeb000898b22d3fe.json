    "abstract": "Current memory tiering systems mitigate asymmetric latency through page migration between tiers. While this approach effectively hides latency, it overlooks scenarios where latency could potentially be tolerated. We propose that an efficient system should integrate both latency reduction (migration) and latency tolerance strategies. Our research demonstrates the effectiveness of prefetchers in tolerating latency within such systems, highlighting their importance in the design of high-performance memory tiering solutions.",
