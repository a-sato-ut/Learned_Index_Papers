    "abstract": "The importance and complexity of spatial join operation resulted in the availability of many join algorithms, some of which are tailored for big-data platforms like Hadoop and Spark. The choice among them is not trivial and depends on different factors. This paper proposes the first machine-learning-based framework for spatial join query optimization which can accommodate both the characteristics of spatial datasets and the complexity of the different algorithms. The main challenge is how to develop portable cost models that once trained can be applied to any pair of input datasets, because they are able to extract the important input characteristics, such as data distribution and spatial partitioning, the logic of spatial join algorithms, and the relationship between the two input datasets. The proposed system defines a set of features that can be computed efficiently for the data to catch the intricate aspects of spatial join. Then, it uses these features to train five machine learning models that are used to identify the best spatial join algorithm. The first two are regression models that estimate two important measures of the spatial join performance and they act as the cost model. The third model chooses the best partitioning strategy to use with spatial join. The fourth and fifth models further tune two important parameters, number of partitions and plane-sweep direction, to get the best performance. Experiments on large-scale synthetic and real data show the efficiency of the proposed models over baseline methods.",
