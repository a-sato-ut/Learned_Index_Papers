    "abstract": "Index selection plays a substantial role in database performance by reducing the I/O cost. Existing index advisors apply different heuristic methods to search the large search space of possible attributes for indexing. These heuristic approaches do not have a mechanism to learn about the goodness of the recommended index set. Thus, they might choose the same index set with a low impact on I/O cost reduction. Learning from their decisions can improve the quality of the recommended index set. We believe that Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is a solution to tackle this issue. Using DRL, an index advisor can improve its decision using the feedbacks of its decisions. In this paper, we propose a DRL-index advisor for a cluster database. We describe the major components such as agent, environment, set of actions, the reward function, and other modules. We conclude the paper with open challenges and possible future work.",
