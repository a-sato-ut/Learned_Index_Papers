    "abstract": "Multimedia databases store high-volume data, which causes problems in efficient information retrieval, and increases execution costs and response times of the queries.  To solve this problem, data fragmentation techniques exist to improve query performance, increase information availability, and efficiently execute more operations accessing less irrelevant data. This article presents a comprehensive review of 34 methods related to hybrid fragmentation and subsequently proposes the design of a hybrid fragmentation method that adapts the scheme according to workload changes to maintain efficient retrieval of multimedia data. The proposed technologies are Java as a programming language, Java Server Faces (JSF) as a framework, MySQL and MongoDB database management systems, and NetBeans as an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), following the UWE methodology (Unified Modeling Language-based Web Engineering).",
