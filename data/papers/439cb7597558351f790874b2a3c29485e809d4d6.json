    "abstract": "The increasing prevalence of Autonomous Systems (AS) powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI) in society and their expanding role in ensuring safety necessitate the assessment of their trustworthiness. The verification and development community faces the challenge of evaluating the trustworthiness of AI-powered AS in a comprehensive and objective manner. To address this challenge, this study conducts a semi-structured interview with experts to gather their insights and perspectives on the trustworthiness of AI-powered autonomous systems in healthcare. By integrating the expert insights, a comprehensive framework is proposed for assessing the trustworthiness of AI-powered autonomous systems in the domain of healthcare. This framework is designed to contribute to the advancement of trustworthiness assessment practices in the field of AI and autonomous systems, fostering greater confidence in their deployment in healthcare settings.",
