    "abstract": "Cardinality Estimation (CardEst) is crucial for query optimization. Despite the remarkable achievement in DBMS, there is a pressing need to test or tune the work of CardEst. To satisfy the need, we introduce Artemis, a customizable workload generator, which can be used to generate various scenarios with the sensitive features for CardEst, including various data dependencies, complex SQL structures, and diverse cardinalities. It designs a PK-oriented deterministic data generation mechanism to plot various data characteristics; a search-based workload generation is proposed for composing queries with various complexities; it takes a constraint optimization-guided way to achieve a cost-effective cardinality calculation. In this demonstration, users can explore the core features of Artemis in generating workloads.",
