    "abstract": "Blockchain-like ledger databases emerge in recent years as a more efficient alternative to permissioned blockchains. Conventional ledger databases mostly rely on authenticated structures such as the Merkle tree and transparency logs for supporting auditability, and hence they suffer from the performance problem. As opposed to conventional ledger DBMSes, we design VeDB - a high-performance verifiable software (Ve-S) and hardware (Ve-H) enabled DBMS with rigorous auditability for better user options and broad applications. In Ve-S, we devise a novel verifiable Shrubs array (VSA) with two-layer ordinals (serial numbers) which outperforms conventional Merkle tree-based models due to lower CPU and I/O cost. It enables rigorous auditability through its efficient credible timestamp range authentication method, and fine-grained data verification at the client side, which are lacking in state-of-the-art relational ledger databases. In Ve-H, we devise a non-intrusive trusted affiliation by TEE leveraging digest signing, monotonic counters, and trusted timestamps in VeDB, which supports both data notarization and lineage applications. The experimental results show that VeDB-VSA outperforms Merkle tree-based authenticated data structures (ADS) up to 70× and 3.7× for insertion and verification; and VeDB Ve-H data lineage verification is 8.5× faster than Ve-S.",
