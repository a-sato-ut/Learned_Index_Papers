    "abstract": "To mitigate climate change, we must reduce carbon emissions from hyperscale cloud computing. We find that cloud compute servers cause the majority of emissions in a general-purpose cloud. Thus, we motivate designing carbon-efficient compute server SKUs, or GreenSKUs, using recently-available low-carbon server components. To this end, we design and build three GreenSKUs using low-carbon components, such as energy-efficient CPUs, reused old DRAM via CXL, and reused old SSDs.We detail several challenges that limit GreenSKUs, carbon savings at scale and may prevent their adoption by cloud providers. To address these challenges, we develop a novel methodology and associated framework, GSF (GreenSKU Framework), that enables a cloud provider to systematically evaluate a GreenSKU’s carbon savings at scale. We implement GSF within Microsoft Azure’s production constraints to evaluate our three GreenSKUs’ carbon savings. Using GSF, we show that our most carbon-efficient GreenSKU reduces emissions per core by $28 \\%$ compared to currently-deployed cloud servers. When designing GreenSKUs to meet applications’ performance requirements, we reduce emissions by $15 \\%$. When incorporating overall data center overheads, our GreenSKU reduces Azure’s net cloud emissions by $8 \\%$.",
