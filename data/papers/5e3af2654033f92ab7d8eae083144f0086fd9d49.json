    "abstract": "The Database Autonomy Service (DAS) is a platform designed to assist database administrators in managing a large number of database instances within major internet companies. One of the key tasks in DAS is to find missing indexes to improve the slow query execution. In Meituan, a vast array of business lines deploy tens of thousands of MySQL database instances. Consequently, a great number of human-generated index cases are accumulated in the DAS platform. This motivates us to build a data-driven index recommendation system, referred to as idxLearner, which can learn index creation knowledge from human-generated index cases. In this demonstration, users can interact with idxLearner by choosing source databases to construct the training data, training the recommendation model, inputting slow queries for various target databases, and observing the recommended indexes and their evaluation results.",
