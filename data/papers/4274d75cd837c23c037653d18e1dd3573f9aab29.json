    "abstract": "In the IoT and 5G-driven data era, real-time anomaly detection for high-dimensional streaming data faces challenges in optimizing both the accuracy and QoS. Aiming at the drawbacks of traditional methods, such as neglecting computational energy efficiency in feature selection and lacking dynamic adaptability in the transfer learning process, this paper proposes an anomaly detection model for streaming data with integrated QoS optimization. It innovates through three mechanisms: a multi-objective feature selection framework considering information gain and energy cost, a priority-based dynamic resource allocation for the bat algorithm, and a QoS-driven spectral transform transfer mechanism. Experimental results show that show that our proposal improves traditional methods. The MS algorithm has the most significant gains: $71.5 \\% ~\\mathrm{F} 1$-score increase, 42.1% end-to-end delay reduction, and 38.7% energy consumption cut.",
