    "abstract": "We study the approximability of the MaxCut problem in the presence of predictions. Specifically, we consider two models: in the noisy predictions model, for each vertex we are given its correct label in $\\{-1,+1\\}$ with some unknown probability $1/2 + \\epsilon$, and the other (incorrect) label otherwise. In the more-informative partial predictions model, for each vertex we are given its correct label with probability $\\epsilon$ and no label otherwise. We assume only pairwise independence between vertices in both models. We show how these predictions can be used to improve on the worst-case approximation ratios for this problem. Specifically, we give an algorithm that achieves an $\\alpha + \\widetilde{\\Omega}(\\epsilon^4)$-approximation for the noisy predictions model, where $\\alpha \\approx 0.878$ is the MaxCut threshold. While this result also holds for the partial predictions model, we can also give a $\\beta + \\Omega(\\epsilon)$-approximation, where $\\beta \\approx 0.858$ is the approximation ratio for MaxBisection given by Raghavendra and Tan. This answers a question posed by Ola Svensson in his plenary session talk at SODA'23.",
