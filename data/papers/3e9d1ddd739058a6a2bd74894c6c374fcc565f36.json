    "abstract": "This workshop explores challenges in responsible information retrieval system development and deployment. The focus is on determining actionable research agendas on five key dimensions of responsible information retrieval: fairness, accountability, confidentiality, transparency, and safety. Rather than just a mini-conference, this workshop is an event during which participants are expected to work. The workshop brings together a diverse set of researchers and practitioners interested in contributing to the development of a technical research agenda for responsible information retrieval.",
