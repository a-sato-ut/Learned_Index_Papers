    "abstract": "The Transformer Memory as a Differentiable Search Index (DSI) has been proposed as a new information retrieval paradigm, which aims to address the limitations of dual-encoder retrieval framework based on the similarity score. The DSI framework outperforms strong baselines by directly generating relevant document identifiers from queries without relying on an explicit index. The memorization power of DSI framework makes it suitable for personalized retrieval tasks. Therefore, we propose a Personal Transformer Memory (PersonalTM) architecture for personalized text retrieval. PersonalTM incorporates user-specific profiles and contextual user click behaviors, and introduces hierarchical loss in the decoding process to align with the hierarchical assignment of document identifier. Additionally, PersonalTM also employs an adapter architecture to improve the scalability for index updates and reduce computation costs, compared to the vanilla DSI. Experiments show that PersonalTM outperforms the DSI baseline, BM25, fine-tuned dual-encoder, and other personalized models in terms of precision at top 1st and 10th positions and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR). Specifically, PersonalTM improves p@1 by 58%, 49%, and 12% compared to BM25, Dual-encoder, and DSI, respectively.",
