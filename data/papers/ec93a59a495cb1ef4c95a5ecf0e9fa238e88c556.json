    "abstract": "Data-driven methods and data science are important scientific methods in many research fields. All data science approaches require professional data engineering components. At the moment, computer science experts are needed for solving these data engineering tasks. Simultaneously, scientists from many fields (like natural sciences, medicine, environmental sciences, and engineering) want to analyse their data autonomously. The arising task for data engineering is the development of tools that can support an automated data curation and are utilisable for domain experts. In this article, we will introduce four generations of data engineering approaches classifying the data engineering technologies of the past and presence. We will show which data engineering tools are needed for the scientific landscape of the next decade.",
