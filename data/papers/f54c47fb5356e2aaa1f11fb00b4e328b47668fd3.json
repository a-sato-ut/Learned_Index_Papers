    "abstract": "The capabilities of quantum computers, such as the number of supported qubits and maximum circuit depth, have grown exponentially in recent years. Commercially relevant applications that take advantage of quantum computing are expected to be available soon. In this paper, we shed light on the possibilities of accelerating database tasks using quantum computing with examples of optimizing queries and transaction schedules and present some open challenges for future studies in the field.",
