    "abstract": "The rising popularity of phenomena such as ubiquitous computing and IoT poses increasingly high demands for data management, and it is not uncommon that database management systems (DBMS) must be capable of reading and writing hundreds of operations per second. Vector DBMSs (VDBMS) are novel products that focus on the management of vector data and can alleviate data management pressures by storing data objects such as logs, system calls, emails, network flow data, and memory dumps in feature vectors that are computationally efficient in both storage and information retrieval. VDMBSs allow efficient nearest neighbour similarity search on complex data objects, which can be used in various cyber security applications such as anomaly, intrusion, malware detection, user behaviour analysis, and network flow analysis. This study describes VDBMSs and some of their use cases in cyber security.",
