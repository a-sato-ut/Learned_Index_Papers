    "abstract": "Emerging applications---cloud computing, the internet of things, and augmented/virtual reality---demand responsive, secure, and scalable datacenter networks. These networks currently implement simple, per-packet, data-plane heuristics (e.g., ECMP and sketches) under a slow, millisecond-latency control plane that runs data-driven performance and security policies. However, to meet applications' service-level objectives (SLOs) in a modern data center, networks must bridge the gap between line-rate, per-packet execution and complex decision making. In this work, we present the design and implementation of Taurus, a data plane for line-rate inference. Taurus adds custom hardware based on a flexible, parallel-patterns (MapReduce) abstraction to programmable network devices, such as switches and NICs; this new hardware uses pipelined SIMD parallelism to enable per-packet MapReduce operations (e.g., inference). Our evaluation of a Taurus switch ASIC---supporting several real-world models---shows that Taurus operates orders of magnitude faster than a server-based control plane while increasing area by 3.8% and latency for line-rate ML models by up to 221 ns. Furthermore, our Taurus FPGA prototype achieves full model accuracy and detects two orders of magnitude more events than a state-of-the-art control-plane anomaly-detection system.",
