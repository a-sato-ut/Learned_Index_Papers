    "abstract": "Neural networks are increasingly applied in safety critical domains, their veriﬁcation thus is gain-ing importance. A large class of recent algorithms for proving input-output relations of feed-forward neural networks are based on linear relaxations and symbolic interval propagation. However, due to variable dependencies, the approxima-tions deteriorate with increasing depth of the network. In this paper we present DPN EURIFY FV, a novel branch-and-bound solver for ReLU networks with low dimensional input-space that is based on symbolic interval propagation with fresh variables and input-splitting. A new heuristic for choosing the fresh variables allows to ameliorate the dependency problem, while our novel splitting heuristic, in combination with several other improvements, speeds up the branch-and-bound procedure. We evaluate our approach on the airborne collision avoidance networks ACAS Xu and demonstrate runtime improvements compared to state-of-the-art tools.",
