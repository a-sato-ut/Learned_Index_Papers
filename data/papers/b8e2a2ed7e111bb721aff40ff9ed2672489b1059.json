    "abstract": "Abstract:The apotheoses in Augustan poetry, which range from tropes of a leader’s fame reaching the stars to full-blown catasterisms, participate in a Roman appropriation, contestation, and management of Hellenistic monarchical discourse that is as old as Rome’s claims to inherit global rule from the East. The present paper studies texts from Ennius to Lucan, with the greatest attention given to Virgil’s, Horace’s and Ovid’s transculturations of Ptolemaic encomium for the new Caesar-ean dynasts. As Roman leaders approximate Hellenistic rulers, Latin encomium stages an assimilation between poet and leader, both engaged in a contest over authenticity that depends on a closer imitation/emulation of Hellenism. In consequence, legitimating tropes of teleology and singular merit, resolved into poetic discourse, undergo the destabilizing polyphony native to intertextuality and interculturalism.",
