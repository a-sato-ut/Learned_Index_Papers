    "abstract": "Cardinality estimation has long been crucial for cost-based database optimizers in identifying optimal query execution plans, attracting significant attention over the past decades. While recent advancements have significantly improved the accuracy of multi-table join query estimations, these methods introduce challenges such as higher space overhead, increased latency, and greater complexity, especially when integrated with the binary join framework. In this paper, we introduce a novel cardinality estimation method named TKHist, which addresses these challenges by relaxing the uniformity assumption in histograms. TKHist captures bin-wise non-uniformity information, enabling accurate cardinality estimation for join queries without filter predicates. Furthermore, we explore the attribute independent assumption, which can lead to significant over-estimation rather than under-estimation in multi-table join queries. To address this issue, we propose the dominating join path correlation discovery algorithm to highlight and manage correlations between join keys and filter predicates. Our extensive experiments on popular benchmarks demonstrate that TKHist reduces error variance by 2-3 orders of magnitude compared to SOTA methods, while maintaining comparable or lower memory usage.",
