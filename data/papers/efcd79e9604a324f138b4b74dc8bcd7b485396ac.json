    "abstract": "Infographics are an aesthetic visual representation of information following specific design principles of human perception. Designing infographics can be a tedious process for non‐experts and time‐consuming, even for professional designers. With the help of designers, we propose a semi‐automated infographic framework for general structured and flow‐based infographic design generation. For novice designers, our framework automatically creates and ranks infographic designs for a user‐provided text with no requirement for design input. However, expert designers can still provide custom design inputs to customize the infographics. We will also contribute an individual visual group (VG) designs dataset (in SVG), along with a 1k complete infographic image dataset with segmented VGs in this work. Evaluation results confirm that by using our framework, designers from all expertise levels can generate generic infographic designs faster than existing methods while maintaining the same quality as hand‐designed infographics templates.",
