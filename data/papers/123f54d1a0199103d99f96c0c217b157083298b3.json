    "abstract": "We study the succinct representations of vertex cuts by centralized oracles and labeling schemes. For an undirected $n$-vertex graph $G = (V,E)$ and integer parameter $f \\geq 1$, the goal is supporting vertex cut queries: Given $F \\subseteq V$ with $|F| \\leq f$, determine if $F$ is a vertex cut in $G$. In the centralized data structure setting, it is required to preprocess $G$ into an $f$-vertex cut oracle that can answer such queries quickly, while occupying only small space. In the labeling setting, one should assign a short label to each vertex in $G$, so that a cut query $F$ can be answered by merely inspecting the labels assigned to the vertices in $F$. While the ``$st$ cut variants'' of the above problems have been extensively studied and are known to admit very efficient solutions, the basic (global) ``cut query'' setting is essentially open (particularly for $f>3$). This work achieves the first significant progress on these problems: [$f$-Vertex Cut Labels:] Every $n$-vertex graph admits an $f$-vertex cut labeling scheme, where the labels have length of $\\tilde{O}(n^{1-1/f})$ bits (when $f$ is polylogarithmic in $n$). This nearly matches the recent lower bound given by Long, Pettie and Saranurak (SODA 2025). [$f$-Vertex Cut Oracles:] For $f=O(\\log n)$, every $n$-vertex graph $G$ admits $f$-vertex cut oracle with $\\tilde{O}(n)$ space and $\\tilde{O}(2^f)$ query time. We also show that our $f$-vertex cut oracles for every $1 \\leq f \\leq n$ are optimal up to $n^{o(1)}$ factors (conditioned on plausible fine-grained complexity conjectures). If $G$ is $f$-connected, i.e., when one is interested in \\emph{minimum} vertex cut queries, the query time improves to $\\tilde{O}(f^2)$, for any $1 \\leq f \\leq n$.",
