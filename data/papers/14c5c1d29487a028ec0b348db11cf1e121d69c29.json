    "abstract": "Range-aggregate query is an important type of queries with numerous applications. It aims to obtain some structural information (defined by an aggregate function $F(\\cdot)$) of the points (from a point set $P$) inside a given query range $B$. In this paper, we study the range-aggregate query problem in high dimensional space for two aggregate functions: (1) $F(P \\cap B)$ is the farthest point in $P \\cap B$ to a query point $q$ in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ and (2) $F(P \\cap B)$ is the minimum enclosing ball (MEB) of $P \\cap B$. For problem (1), called In-Range Farthest Point (IFP) Query, we develop a bi-criteria approximation scheme: For any $\\epsilon>0$ that specifies the approximation ratio of the farthest distance and any $\\gamma>0$ that measures the\"fuzziness\"of the query range, we show that it is possible to pre-process $P$ into a data structure of size $\\tilde{O}_{\\epsilon,\\gamma}(dn^{1+\\rho})$ in $\\tilde{O}_{\\epsilon,\\gamma}(dn^{1+\\rho})$ time such that given any $\\mathbb{R}^d$ query ball $B$ and query point $q$, it outputs in $\\tilde{O}_{\\epsilon,\\gamma}(dn^{\\rho})$ time a point $p$ that is a $(1-\\epsilon)$-approximation of the farthest point to $q$ among all points lying in a $(1+\\gamma)$-expansion $B(1+\\gamma)$ of $B$, where $0<\\rho<1$ is a constant depending on $\\epsilon$ and $\\gamma$ and the hidden constants in big-O notations depend only on $\\epsilon$, $\\gamma$ and $\\text{Polylog}(nd)$. For problem (2), we show that the IFP result can be applied to develop query scheme with similar time and space complexities to achieve a $(1+\\epsilon)$-approximation for MEB.",
