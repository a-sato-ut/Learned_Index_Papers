    "abstract": "Simple Summary This study assembled a high-quality chromosome-level genome of the Meishan pig using Illumina and PacBio sequencing technologies. By integrating this new genome with existing pig genome assemblies, we contribute to developing a pig pan-genome, facilitating research on structural variations. Selective sweep analysis between the Chinese wild boar and the Meishan pig revealed key candidate genes, such as TBX19 and PGR, linked to domestication traits. These findings provide valuable genetic resources for studying Meishan pig biology and offer a foundation for improving breeding strategies and conservation efforts.",
