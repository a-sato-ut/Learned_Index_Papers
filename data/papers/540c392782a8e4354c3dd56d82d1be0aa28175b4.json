    "abstract": "This study evaluates the impact of an AI Tutor in enhancing learning outcomes within a private university in Lima. Implemented across eight high-demand introductory courses, a controlled experimental design compared academic performance and engagement metrics between sections with AI Tutor access and those without. Metrics included usage rates, student satisfaction, on-time submission, grade improvement, and course retention. Results showed that the AI Tutor significantly boosted student engagement, satisfaction, and performance, underscoring the potential of AI tools to drive academic success in higher education.",
