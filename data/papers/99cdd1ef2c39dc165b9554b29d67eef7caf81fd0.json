    "abstract": "In this paper we introduce the \\emph{semi-online} model that generalizes the classical online computational model. The semi-online model postulates that the unknown future has a predictable part and an adversarial part; these parts can be arbitrarily interleaved. An algorithm in this model operates as in the standard online model, i.e., makes an irrevocable decision at each step. \nWe consider bipartite matching in the semi-online model, for both integral and fractional cases. Our main contributions are competitive algorithms for this problem that are close to or match a hardness bound. The competitive ratio of the algorithms nicely interpolates between the truly offline setting (no adversarial part) and the truly online setting (no predictable part).",
