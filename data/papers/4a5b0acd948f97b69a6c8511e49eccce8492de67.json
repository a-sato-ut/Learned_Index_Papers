    "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce DeepSwapper, a deep learning-based page swap management scheme that utilizes RNN to perform fast, energy-efficient, and temperature-aware page swapping in hybrid memory systems. DeepSwapper comprises of LSTM units of RNN model to predict the future memory accesses to guide its swap management scheme, a dynamic page swap management scheme that utilizes DRAM capacity efficiently by enabling hot pages in a swap group to be swapped with cold pages of another swap group, and a temperature-aware page swap management scheme, which first predicts the future writes to NVM pages and then, decides to migrate those pages with frequent writes in hot NVM banks to DRAM to enhance the NVM lifetime.",
