    "abstract": "We consider an incremental variant of the rooted prize-collecting Steiner-tree problem with a growing budget constraint. While no incremental solution exists that simultaneously approximates the optimum for all budgets, we show that a bicriterial $(\\alpha,\\mu)$-approximation is possible, i.e., a solution that with budget $B+\\alpha$ for all $B \\in \\mathbb{R}_{\\geq 0}$ is a multiplicative $\\mu$-approximation compared to the optimum solution with budget $B$. For the case that the underlying graph is a tree, we present a polynomial-time density-greedy algorithm that computes a $(\\chi,1)$-approximation, where $\\chi$ denotes the eccentricity of the root vertex in the underlying graph, and show that this is best possible. An adaptation of the density-greedy algorithm for general graphs is $(\\gamma,2)$-competitive where $\\gamma$ is the maximal length of a vertex-disjoint path starting in the root. While this algorithm does not run in polynomial time, it can be adapted to a $(\\gamma,3)$-competitive algorithm that runs in polynomial time. We further devise a capacity-scaling algorithm that guarantees a $(3\\chi,8)$-approximation and, more generally, a $\\smash{\\bigl((4\\ell - 1)\\chi, \\frac{2^{\\ell + 2}}{2^{\\ell}-1}\\bigr)}$-approximation for every fixed $\\ell \\in \\mathbb{N}$.",
