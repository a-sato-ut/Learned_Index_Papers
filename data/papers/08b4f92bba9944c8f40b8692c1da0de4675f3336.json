    "abstract": "Sparse Voxel Directed Acyclic Graphs (SVDAGs) have proven to be an efficient data structure for storing sparse binary voxel scenes. The SVDAG exploits repeating geometric patterns; which can be improved when considering mirror symmetries. We extend the previous work by providing a generalized framework to efficiently involve additional types of transformations and propose a novel translation matching for even more geometry reuse. Our new data structure is stored using a novel pointer encoding scheme to achieve a practical reduction in memory usage.",
