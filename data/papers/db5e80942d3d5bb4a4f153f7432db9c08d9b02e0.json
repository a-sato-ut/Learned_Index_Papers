    "abstract": "Abstract:This article explores the question of (cultivating) taste in ancient criticism and argues that Dionysius of Halicarnassus, in his critical essays on good rhetoric and criticism, uses a term to denote (what we might now call) a sense of taste, alogos aisthêsis. According to Dionysius, it is a faculty that enables us to better appreciate literature as well as cultivate character, but one that escapes close scrutiny and explanation. A more detailed contextualization of Dionysius's engagement with alogos aisthêsis within his contemporary moment suggests that it is best read in light of broader attempts among his contemporary thinkers to sketch out the boundaries of, and a novel vision for, the new cultural history of the empire.",
