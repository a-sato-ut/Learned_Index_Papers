    "abstract": "The approximate membership query (AMQ) data structure is a kind of space-efficient probabilistic data structure. It can approximately indicate whether an element exists in a set. The AMQ data structure has been widely used in database indexing, network security, IoT applications, etc. Resizing is an extensively utilized operation of the AMQ data structure, but it can lead to system performance degradation. We summarize two main problems that lead to such degradation. Specifically, one of them is that the resizing operation can block other operations, while the other is that the performance of AMQ structures will deteriorate after multiple resizing operations. However, existing related work cannot alleviate both of them. Therefore, we propose a novel AMQ data structure called bamboo filter, which can alleviate the two problems simultaneously. Bamboo filters can insert, search and delete an element in constant time. Moreover, bamboo filters can dynamically resize in a fine-grained way according to the number of contained elements. Experimental results show that bamboo filters significantly outperform state-of-the-art resizable AMQ data structures in insertion, lookup, and deletion operations. For example, bamboo filters achieve $\\mathbf{2.46}\\times$ lookup throughput of the dynamic cuckoo filter, on average.",
