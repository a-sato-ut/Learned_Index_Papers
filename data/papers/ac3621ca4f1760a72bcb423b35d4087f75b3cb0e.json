    "abstract": "The competitive auction was first proposed by Goldberg, Hartline, and Wright. In their paper [Goldberg et al, 2001], they introduce the competitive analysis framework of online algorithm design into the traditional revenue-maximizing auction design problem. While the competitive analysis framework only cares about the worst-case bound, a growing body of work in the online algorithm community studies the learning-augmented framework. In this framework, designers are allowed to leverage imperfect machine-learned predictions of unknown information and pursue better theoretical guarantees when the prediction is accurate(consistency). Meanwhile, designers also need to maintain a nearly-optimal worst-case ratio(robustness). In this work, we revisit the competitive auctions in the learning-augmented setting. We leverage the imperfect predictions of the private value of the bidders and design the learning-augmented mechanisms for several competitive auctions with different constraints, including: digital good auctions, limited-supply auctions, and general downward-closed permutation environments. We also design the learning-augmented mechanism for online auctions. For all these auction environments, our mechanisms enjoy 1-consistency against the strongest benchmark OPT. In contrast, it is impossible to achieve O(1)-competitiveness against OPT without predictions. At the same time, our mechanisms also maintain the O(1)-robustness against all benchmarks considered in the traditional competitive analysis, including ℱ(2), maxV, and EFO(2). Considering the possible inaccuracy of the predictions, we provide a reduction that transforms our learning-augmented mechanisms into an error-tolerant version, which enables the learning-augmented mechanism to ensure satisfactory revenue in scenarios where the prediction error is moderate. We also prove a 3 robustness ratio lower bound for mechanisms with perfect consistency. The lower bound is strictly greater than the optimal 2.42 competitive ratio of digital good auctions, showing the impossibility of maintaining the optimal worst-case bound with perfect consistency.",
