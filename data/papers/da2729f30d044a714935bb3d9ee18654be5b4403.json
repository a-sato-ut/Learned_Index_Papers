    "abstract": "The most daunting and conflicting challenges accompanying the wireless sensor networks are energy and security. And data aggregation and compression techniques are two of the effective ways to reduce energy consumption. As it is known that the radio transceiver consumes energy which is proportional to the number of bits transmitted on the network; hence sending fewer bits on the communication channel implies lesser energy consumption. This paper works on compressing the index of secure index on distributed data (SIDD) technique; to reduce the number of bits of an index that is transmitted on the communication channel. The objective being to reduce energy consumption of SIDD. In this paper, we have worked to reduce the number of bits of the index sent on the communication channel, deploying difference encoding. The compression mechanism has established an upper bound on the energy consumption whilst all data items were unique. The scheme is scalable and can be deployed for saving energy consumption.",
