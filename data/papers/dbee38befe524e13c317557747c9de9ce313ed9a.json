    "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel approach to solving partial differential equations (PDEs) using machine learning techniques, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Traditional methods like the finite-difference method (FDM) discretize PDEs into systems of linear equations, which are then solved iteratively. Our method optimizes existing solvers by learning update rules using CNNs, ensuring convergence while enhancing performance. We focus on the Poisson equation and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments on various problem instances. The results show significant performance improvements without sacrificing convergence, paving the way for more efficient numerical methods in solving PDEs.",
