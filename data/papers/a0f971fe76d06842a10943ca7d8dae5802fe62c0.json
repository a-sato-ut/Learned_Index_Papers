    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) provide powerful foundations to perform fine-grained text re-ranking. However, they are often prohibitive in reality due to constraints on computation bandwidth. In this work, we propose a flexible architecture called Matroyshka Re-Ranker, which is designed to facilitate runtime customization of model layers and sequence lengths at each layer based on users' configurations. Consequently, the LLM-based re-rankers can be made applicable across various real-world situations. The increased flexibility may come at the cost of precision loss. To address this problem, we introduce a suite of techniques to optimize the performance. First, we propose cascaded self-distillation, where each sub-architecture learns to preserve a precise re-ranking performance from its super components, whose predictions can be exploited as smooth and informative teacher signals. Second, we design a factorized compensation mechanism, where two collaborative LoRA modules, vertical and horizontal, are jointly employed to compensate for the precision loss resulted from arbitrary combinations of layer and sequence compression. We perform comprehensive experiments using passage and document retrieval datasets from MSMARCO, along with all public datasets from BEIR. In our experiments, Matryoshka Re-Ranker substantially outperforms existing methods, while effectively preserving its superior performance across various compression forms and application scenarios. We have publicly released our method at this https://github.com/FlagOpen/FlagEmbedding repo.",
