    "abstract": "With the rapid development of the Internet of Things, machine learning applications on edge devices with limited resources face challenges due to large data scales and irregular memory access patterns. Non-volatile memory (NVM) technologies provide promising solutions by offering larger capacity, low leakage power, and data persistence. In this paper, we discuss the potential of NVM technology in enhancing machine learning applications by improving energy efficiency and reducing latency through in-memory computation and different NVM write modes. The insights from this analysis provide valuable guidance to device researchers and system architects working to develop highperformance systems for machine learning and accelerators in large-scale search applications using NVMs.",
