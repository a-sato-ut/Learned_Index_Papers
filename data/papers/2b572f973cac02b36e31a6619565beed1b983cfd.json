    "abstract": "In an era dominated by information overload, effective recommender systems are essential for managing the deluge of data across digital platforms. Multi-stage cascade ranking systems are widely used in the industry, with retrieval and ranking being two typical stages. Retrieval methods sift through vast candidates to filter out irrelevant items, while ranking methods prioritize these candidates to present the most relevant items to users. Unlike studies focusing on the ranking stage, this survey explores the critical yet often overlooked retrieval stage of recommender systems. To achieve precise and efficient personalized retrieval, we summarize existing work in three key areas: improving similarity computation between user and item, enhancing indexing mechanisms for efficient retrieval, and optimizing training methods of retrieval. We also provide a comprehensive set of benchmarking experiments on three public datasets. Furthermore, we highlight current industrial applications through a case study on retrieval practices at a specific company, covering the entire retrieval process and online serving, along with practical implications and challenges. By detailing the retrieval stage, which is fundamental for effective recommendation, this survey aims to bridge the existing knowledge gap and serve as a cornerstone for researchers interested in optimizing this critical component of cascade recommender systems.",
