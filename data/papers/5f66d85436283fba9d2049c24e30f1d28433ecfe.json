    "abstract": "The continuous growth of data production in almost all scientific areas raises new problems in data access and management, especially in a scenario where the end-users, as well as the resources that they can access, are worldwide distributed. This work is focused on the data caching management in a Data Lake infrastructure in the context of the High Energy Physics field. We are proposing an autonomous method, based on Reinforcement Learning techniques, to improve the user experience and to contain the maintenance costs of the infrastructure.",
