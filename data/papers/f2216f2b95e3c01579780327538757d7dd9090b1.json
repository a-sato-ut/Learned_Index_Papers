    "abstract": "Automated news article classification is a method of categorizing textual data into predefined classes. Addressing this problem finds applications in diverse domains, including information retrieval, topic modeling, sentiment analysis and content recommendation systems. In Albanian, though there is a rapid increase of digital content, there is limited availability of text corpora, presenting significant obstacles for advancement of natural language processing research and applications. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we introduce a dataset consisting of 9600 news article titles spanning across various categories. Second, we utilize this dataset to assess the effectiveness of several machine learning algorithms for topic classification. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of recurrent neural networks in comparison to simpler classifiers and ensemble methods.",
