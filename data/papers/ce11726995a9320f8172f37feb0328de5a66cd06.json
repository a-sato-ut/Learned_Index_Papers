    "abstract": "We present a vision called \"value co-creation of software by artificial intelligence (AI) and developers.\" In this vision, AI and developers work in collaboration as equal partners to co-create business and societal values through software system development and operations. Towards this vision, we discuss AI automation for development focusing on machine learning by introducing examples, including our own. Finally, we envision the future of value co-creation by AI and developers.",
