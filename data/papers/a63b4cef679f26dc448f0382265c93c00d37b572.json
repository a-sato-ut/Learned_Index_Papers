    "abstract": "In the fields of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), automated machine learning (Auto-ML) is a very hot research topic. Auto-ML is an end-to-end process that can be used to automate the model development pipeline without any external assistance. Almost any kind of information can be used from data. The huge majority of the information and data are accessible on the internet. The majority of the data for machine learning may be divided into three basic categories: binary, multi-class, and text. The existing research in the areas of Auto-ML libraries, such as AutoWEKA, TPOT, H2O, and Auto-Sklearn are analyzed in this study. The benefits and constraints of the various techniques, as well as their evaluations in terms of attributes supported by algorithms, are investigated. This study is the start of consistent and continuous research, and future work will expand on this information to create a design that will fill any research gaps and complete the exploration of research.",
