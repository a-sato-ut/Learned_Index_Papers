    "abstract": "Database systems that autonomously manage their configuration and physical database design face numerous challenges: They need to anticipate future workloads, find satisfactory and robust configurations efficiently, and learn from recent actions. We describe a component-based framework for self-managed database systems to facilitate development and database integration with low overhead by relying on a clear separation of concerns. Our framework results in exchangeable and reusable components, which simplify experiments and promote further research. Furthermore, we propose an LP-based algorithm to find an efficient order to tune multiple dependent features in a recursive way.",
