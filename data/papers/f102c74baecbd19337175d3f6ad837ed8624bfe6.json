    "abstract": "Research in conversational information seeking (CIS) is moving very rapidly in various directions such as user interaction, system design, and evaluation. The tutorial focuses on the theoretical foundations and information-seeking processes for CIS, as well as their evaluation. The tutorial aims to introduce and communicate CIS research to the community and discuss it from different perspectives, such as theoretical modelling, evaluation, and user simulation. Also, it aims at gathering researchers and practitioners interested in this research direction for discussions, idea communications, and research promotions.",
