    "abstract": "Parallel imaging and compressed sensing reconstructions of large MRI datasets often have a prohibitive computational cost that bottlenecks clinical deployment, especially for three‐dimensional (3D) non‐Cartesian acquisitions. One common approach is to reduce the number of coil channels actively used during reconstruction as in coil compression. While effective for Cartesian imaging, coil compression inherently loses signal energy, producing shading artifacts that compromise image quality for 3D non‐Cartesian imaging. We propose coil sketching, a general and versatile method for computationally‐efficient iterative MR image reconstruction.",
