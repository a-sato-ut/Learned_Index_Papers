    "abstract": "Estimating the support size of a distribution is a well-studied problem in statistics. Motivated by the fact that this problem is highly non-robust (as small perturbations in the distributions can drastically affect the support size) and thus hard to estimate, Goldreich [ECCC 2019] studied the query complexity of estimating the $\\epsilon$-\\emph{effective support size} $\\text{Ess}_\\epsilon$ of a distribution ${P}$, which is equal to the smallest support size of a distribution that is $\\epsilon$-far in total variation distance from ${P}$. In his paper, he shows an algorithm in the dual access setting (where we may both receive random samples and query the sampling probability $p(x)$ for any $x$) for a bicriteria approximation, giving an answer in $[\\text{Ess}_{(1+\\beta)\\epsilon},(1+\\gamma) \\text{Ess}_{\\epsilon}]$ for some values $\\beta, \\gamma>0$. However, his algorithm has either super-constant query complexity in the support size or super-constant approximation ratio $1+\\gamma = \\omega(1)$. He then asked if this is necessary, or if it is possible to get a constant-factor approximation in a number of queries independent of the support size. We answer his question by showing that not only is complexity independent of $n$ possible for $\\gamma>0$, but also for $\\gamma=0$, that is, that the bicriteria relaxation is not necessary. Specifically, we show an algorithm with query complexity $O(\\frac{1}{\\beta^3 \\epsilon^3})$. That is, for any $0<\\epsilon, \\beta<1$, we output in this complexity a number $\\tilde{n} \\in [\\text{Ess}_{(1+\\beta)\\epsilon},\\text{Ess}_\\epsilon]$. We also show that it is possible to solve the approximate version with approximation ratio $1+\\gamma$ in complexity $O\\left(\\frac{1}{\\beta^2 \\epsilon} + \\frac{1}{\\beta \\epsilon \\gamma^2}\\right)$. Our algorithm is very simple, and has $4$ short lines of pseudocode.",
