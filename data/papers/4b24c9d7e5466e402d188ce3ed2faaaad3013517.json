    "abstract": "Query optimization is critical in relational database management systems (DBMSs) for ensuring efficient query processing. The query optimizer relies on precise selectivity and cost estimates to generate optimal query plans for execution. However, this static query optimization approach falls short for DBMSs handling machine learning (ML) queries. ML-centric DBMSs face distinct challenges in query optimization. First, performance bottlenecks shift to user-defined functions (UDFs), often encapsulating deep learning models, making it difficult to estimate UDF statistics without profiling the query. Second, optimal query plans for ML queries are data-dependent, requiring dynamic plan adjustments during execution. To address these challenges, we introduce Aero, an ML-centric DBMS that utilizes adaptive query processing (AQP) for efficiently processing ML queries. Aero optimizes the evaluation of UDF-based query predicates by dynamically adjusting predicate evaluation order and enhancing UDF execution scalability. By integrating AQP, Aero continuously monitors UDF statistics, routes data to predicates in an optimal order, and dynamically allocates resources for evaluating predicates. Aero achieves up to 6.4x speedup compared to a state-of-the-art ML-centric DBMS across four diverse use cases, with no impact on accuracy.",
