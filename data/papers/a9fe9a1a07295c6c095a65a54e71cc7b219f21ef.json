    "abstract": "The vision of HIPstIR is that early stage information retrieval (IR) researchers get together to develop a future for non-mainstream ideas and research agendas in IR. The first iteration of this vision materialized in the form of a three day workshop in Portsmouth, New Hampshire attended by 24 researchers across academia and industry. Attendees pre-submitted one or more topics that they want to pitch at the meeting. Then over the three days during the workshop, we self-organized into groups and worked on six specific proposals of common interest. In this report, we present an overview of the workshop and brief summaries of the six proposals that resulted from the workshop.",
