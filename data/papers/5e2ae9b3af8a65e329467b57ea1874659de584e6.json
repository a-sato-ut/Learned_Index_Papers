    "abstract": "Named Data Networking (NDN) with the data-centric design has been viewed as a promising future Internet architecture. It requires a new security model orienting data but not host. In this paper, a Hierarchical Identity-based Security Mechanism by Blockchain (HISM-B) is to be proposed for NDN networks. It could satisfy the two assumptions specified in the NDN testbed to maintain the data-oriented authentication. At one hand, the hierarchical identity-based cryptology is used to bind the data name with the public key and then two signatures are encapsulated in the data packet so that the data source authentication and the integrity of data packet can be supported. At the other hand, a blockchain is employed to manage public keys for different domains to avoid catastrophes due to a single node failure. The validation result shows that the proposed HISM-B is safe.",
