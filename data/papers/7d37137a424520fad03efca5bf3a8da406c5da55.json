    "abstract": "Abstract:This chapter considers the potential of \"hate-reading\" as an approach to literature and tradition. It draws on Theodor Adorno's and Friedrich Nietzsche's analyses of culture, and on a psychoanalytic conception of hatred articulated by Joan Riviere. It suggests that hatred could be an important and potentially generative form of aesthetic relation, discussing Socrates' banishment of the poets in Plato's Republic as a central example. Finally, it elucidates the author's hatred of Virgil's Aeneid and argues that hatred enables a valuable personal and pedagogical relation to the text and its tradition.",
