    "abstract": "This panel encourages a debate over the future of database education and its relationship to Data Science: Are Computer Science (CS) and Data Science (DS) different disciplines about to split, and how does that effect how we teach our field? Is there a \"data\" course that belongs in CS that all of our students should take? Who is the traditional database course, e.g. based on the \"cow book\", relevant to? What traditional topics should we not be teaching in our core data course(s) and which ones should be added? What do we teach the student who has one elective for data science? How does our community position itself for leadership in CS given the popularity of DS?",
