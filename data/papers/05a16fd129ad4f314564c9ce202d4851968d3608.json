    "abstract": "Distributed in-memory processing frameworks accelerate application runs by caching important datasets in memory. Allocating a suitable cluster configuration for caching these datasets plays a crucial role in achieving minimal cost. We present Agile-ant, a self-managing framework that identifies important datasets and scales out the cluster memory to cache them on the fly without any human interaction, without any prior knowledge of the application, the characteristics of the input data, the specification of the computing resources and their utilization by multiple-tenants. We evaluate Agile-ant on various real-world applications. Compared with our baseline, Agile-ant reduces execution cost by 78.3% on average and provides better performance than the related work.",
