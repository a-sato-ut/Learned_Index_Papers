    "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) aims to achieve rapid content transmission for real-time surveillance. The in-network caching and aggregation of the information-centric model can help enhance efficiency of content transmission, so it is integrated with IoT, called information-centric IoT (ICIoT), to transmit content. NDN is not originally designed for IoT, so ICIoT faces the following challenges when achieving in-network caching and aggregation: 1) mobility and resource insufficiency of IoT devices lead to frequent reverse-path disruptions; 2) the strategy of caching everything everywhere (CEE) is inefficient in IoT with limited storage resources; and 3) NDN does not maintain forwarding information toward caching providers. Taking these challenges into account, we propose an ICIoT-based routing and real-time content transmission for ICIoT, and aim to leverage in-network caching and aggregation to reduce content transmission delays, costs, and failures. The experiment results verify the superiority of the proposal.",
