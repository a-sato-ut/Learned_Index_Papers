    "abstract": "Abstract. We investigate how PCServe, a web service for disseminating massive point clouds, performs for read-only access (i.e. a visualization application). PCServe is backed by a database model based on Space Filling Curves. By adding a virtual hierarchy of blocks to the database, we can support different visualization applications for retrieval of point cloud data over the web without having to store the data multiple times. This makes expressive access to point clouds over the web possible. We investigate the amount of processing that is needed to create the database model and how well PCServe handles requests from the visualization application. Some suggestions are provided how the current approach can be improved.\n",
