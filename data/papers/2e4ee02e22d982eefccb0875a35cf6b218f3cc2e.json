    "abstract": "We study the problem of searching for a target at some unknown location in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ when additional information regarding the position of the target is available in the form of predictions. In our setting, predictions come as approximate distances to the target: for each point $p\\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ that the searcher visits, we obtain a value $\\lambda(p)$ such that $|p\\bm{t}|\\le \\lambda(p) \\le c\\cdot |p\\bm{t}|$, where $c\\ge 1$ is a fixed constant, $\\bm{t}$ is the position of the target, and $|p\\bm{t}|$ is the Euclidean distance of $p$ to $\\bm{t}$. The cost of the search is the length of the path followed by the searcher. Our main positive result is a strategy that achieves $(10c)^{d+1}$-competitive ratio, even when the constant $c$ is unknown. We also give a lower bound of roughly $(c/4)^{d-1}$ on the competitive ratio of any search strategy in $\\RR^d$, assuming that $c\\ge 4$.",
