    "abstract": "We present Zoea Visual which is a visual programming language based on the Zoea composable inductive programming language. Zoea Visual allows users to create software directly from a specification that resembles a set of functional test cases. Programming with Zoea Visual involves the definition of a data flow model of test case inputs, optional intermediate values, and outputs. Data elements are represented visually and can be combined to create structures of any complexity. Data flows between elements provide additional information that allows the Zoea compiler to generate larger programs in less time. This paper includes an overview of the language. The benefits of the approach and some possible future enhancements are also discussed.",
