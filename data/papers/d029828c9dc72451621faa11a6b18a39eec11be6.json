    "abstract": "The contact window scheduling technology supports various space mission requirements of the satellite information network. The continuous emergence of new space missions challenges the scarce satellite contact window scheduling. In this article, We propose a dynamically updated microcloud structure based on digital twin and multiagent system technology. Then, we build an on-satellite autonomous scheduling model based on the microcloud structure and design an efficient solution algorithm to solve the maximum revenue problem of inefficient task scheduling caused by the dynamic change of task priority and satellite position over time. Simulation experiments show that the scheme proposed in this article can significantly improve task scheduling revenue and resource utilization, and have specific enlightening significance for the innovation of satellite task scheduling methods in the future.",
