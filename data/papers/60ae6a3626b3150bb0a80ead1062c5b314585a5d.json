    "abstract": "The modern network aims to prioritize critical traffic over non-critical traffic and effectively manage traffic flow. This necessitates proper buffer management to prevent the loss of crucial traffic while minimizing the impact on non-critical traffic. Therefore, the algorithm's objective is to control which packets to transmit and which to discard at each step. In this study, we initiate the learning-augmented online packet scheduling with deadlines and provide a novel algorithmic framework to cope with the prediction. We show that when the prediction error is small, our algorithm improves the competitive ratio while still maintaining a bounded competitive ratio, regardless of the prediction error.",
