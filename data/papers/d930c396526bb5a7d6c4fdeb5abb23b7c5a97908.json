    "abstract": "We introduce RATS (Resource Allocator for Tumor Simulations), the first optimizer for the execution of tumor simulations over HPC infrastructures. The optimization framework of RATS incorporates 3 vital performance criteria (i) expected utility of a simulation in terms of effective drug combination on the simulated tumor, (ii) simulation execution time and (iii) number of cores required for achieving that execution time. RATS is to be used by life scientists at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center to not only remove the burden of blindly guessing the core hours we need to reserve from HPC admins to study various tumor treatment methodologies, but also to help in more rapidly distinguishing effective drug combinations, thus, potentially cutting time to market for new cancer therapies.",
