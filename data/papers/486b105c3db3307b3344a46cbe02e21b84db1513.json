    "abstract": "Personal data usage and collection are activities that used to grow unrestricted. However, several laws in the physical world ensure rights to people regarding their privacy and information usage. In the last years, legislators passed many laws, regulations, and acts to replicate these rights to the digital world. By doing so, new constraints, rights, and duties appear on every component of the data usage and collection workflow. In this paper, we discuss legislations’ implications, identifying impacts that these regulations introduce to current DBMS, and survey recent works that aim to solve the problems raised by these impacts, highlighting research opportunities and identifying how solutions can be achieved for the problems.",
