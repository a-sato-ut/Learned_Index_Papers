    "abstract": "The paper shows how to convert the pattern DB into the q-gram index structure with the 'next byte range' and how to filter the data item (e.g. packet) using this structure. We indexed the patterns of the given DB as 6byte-part to raise the speed of matching and the utilization of memory. In this paper, we aimed to largely decrease the full-pattern matching system's load(the number of the input data item) and improve the performance of pattern matching by using 'SigArrg', 'next byte range' and 'Bloom Filter'. We made an algorithm so that you can apply it easily to the fields connected with pattern matching, and the experiment result shows that our proposed method speeds up pattern matching. This paper has several scalabilities.",
