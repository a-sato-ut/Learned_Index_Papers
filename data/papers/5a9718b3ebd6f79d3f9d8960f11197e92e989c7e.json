    "abstract": "\n There has been an increasing interest in building cloud-native databases that decouple computation and storage for elasticity. A cloud-native database often adopts a\n cloud storage\n underneath its storage engine, leveraging another layer of virtualization and providing a high-performance and elastic storage service without exposing complex storage details. It helps reduce the maintenance cost and expedite development cycles for the database kernels. We have observed that there are significant differences between the local and the cloud storage that invalid many designs inside existing databases when they are ported to the cloud storage. In this paper, we analyze the challenges and opportunities of both B-tree and LSM-tree-based storage engines when they are deployed on a cloud storage. We propose an optimization framework that guides database developers to transform on-premise databases into their cloud-native counterparts. We use a B+-tree-based InnoDB as a demonstration vehicle where we have implemented a suite of optimizations using the proposed framework and extend such efforts to the LSM-tree-based RocksDB. On both engines, our evaluations show significant performance improvements on the cloud storage.\n",
