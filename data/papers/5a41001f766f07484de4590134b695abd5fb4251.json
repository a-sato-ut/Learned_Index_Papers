    "abstract": "Attention computation takes both the time complexity of $O(n^2)$ and the space complexity of $O(n^2)$ simultaneously, which makes deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) in streaming applications that involve long contexts requiring substantial computational resources. In recent OpenAI DevDay (Nov 6, 2023), OpenAI released a new model that is able to support a 128K-long document, in our paper, we focus on the memory-efficient issue when context length $n$ is much greater than 128K ($n \\gg 2^d$). Considering a single-layer self-attention with Query, Key, and Value matrices $Q, K, V \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$, the polynomial method approximates the attention output $T \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$. It accomplishes this by constructing $U_1, U_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times t}$ to expedite attention ${\\sf Attn}(Q, K, V)$ computation within $n^{1+o(1)}$ time executions. Despite this, computing the approximated attention matrix $U_1U_2^\\top \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ still necessitates $O(n^2)$ space, leading to significant memory usage. In response to these challenges, we introduce a new algorithm that only reads one pass of the data in a streaming fashion. This method employs sublinear space $o(n)$ to store three sketch matrices, alleviating the need for exact $K, V$ storage. Notably, our algorithm exhibits exceptional memory-efficient performance with super-long tokens. As the token length $n$ increases, our error guarantee diminishes while the memory usage remains nearly constant. This unique attribute underscores the potential of our technique in efficiently handling LLMs in streaming applications.",
