    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose Adam-Hash: an adaptive and dynamic multi-resolution hashing data-structure for fast pairwise summation estimation. Given a data-set X ⊂ ℝ<sup>d</sup>, a binary function f : ℝ<sup>d</sup> × ℝ<sup>d</sup> → ℝ, and a point y ∈ ℝ<sup>d</sup>, the Pairwise Summation Estimate $PS{E_X}(y): = \\frac{1}{{\\left| X \\right|}}\\sum\\nolimits_{x \\in X} {f(x,y)} $. For any given data-set X, we need to design a data-structure such that given any query point y ∈ ℝ<sup>d</sup>, the data-structure approximately estimates PSE<inf>X</inf>(y) in time that is sub-linear in |X|. Prior works on this problem have focused exclusively on the case where the data-set is static, and the queries are independent. In this paper, we design a hashing-based PSE data-structure which works for the more practical dynamic setting in which insertions, deletions, and replacements of points are allowed. Moreover, our proposed Adam-Hash is also robust to adaptive PSE queries, where an adversary can choose query q<inf>j</inf> ∈ ℝ<sup>d</sup> depending on the output from previous queries q<inf>1</inf>, q<inf>2</inf>, …, q<inf>j–1</inf>.",
