    "abstract": "To address the breadth of AI quality risks including security ones, we propose the “AI Engineering Continuum” as a comprehensive framework consisting of the following five dimensions necessary from the holistic engineering point of view: AI layer continuum, AI process continuum, AI computing continuum, AI automation continuum, and AI quality continuum. The AI engineering continuum is intended to be used to evaluate the adequacy of AI engineering projects and identify weaknesses that should be improved and aligned with the dimensions of the framework. Furthermore, we discuss necessary engineering features and foundations needed to efficiently and effectively raise each dimension of the framework and demonstrate some of their preliminary implementations, including our past achievements.",
