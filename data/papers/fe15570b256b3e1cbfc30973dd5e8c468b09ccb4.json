    "abstract": "We investigate the potential of applying (D)NN ((deep) neural networks) for approximating nonlinear mappings arising in the finite element discretization of nonlinear PDEs (partial differential equations). As an application, we apply the trained DNN to replace the coarse nonlinear operator thus avoiding the need to visit the fine level discretization in order to evaluate the actions of the true coarse nonlinear operator. The feasibility of the studied approach is demonstrated in a two-level FAS (full approximation scheme) used to solve a nonlinear diffusion-reaction PDE.",
