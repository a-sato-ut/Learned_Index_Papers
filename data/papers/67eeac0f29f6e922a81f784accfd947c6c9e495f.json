    "abstract": "The paper groups the evolution of open data development in various concepts which provided this notion with new interpretation and development possibilities. The article is put together as a review of literature according to classical methodology by Webster and Watson – through the lense of previous studies, theories and practices towards the search of new solutions. Development of the initiatives concerning open data follows the principles of dialectical development in spiral order, with ups and downs on each turn. Although such projects are more successful in countries with stable democratic system, they also have a significant impact on data management in developing economies.",
