    "abstract": "Named Data Networking (NDN) is a proposed solution for the future internet, where the internet is shifting from a host-based model into an information-centric model. Forwarding strategies are a method of how a node forward the received interest packet in NDN. This research compares established forwarding strategies in ndnSIM on NDN-simulated Submarine Optic Fiber Network, the SEA-ME-WE topology. We assess the performance of different forwarding strategies regarding transmission overhead, average total delay, cache hit ratio, and cache eviction rate. Based on our research, the most optimal forwarding strategies used in SEA-ME-WE simulated in ndn is Best-route with the best output based on several performance matrices and the second best for the other matrices with values not far from the best.",
