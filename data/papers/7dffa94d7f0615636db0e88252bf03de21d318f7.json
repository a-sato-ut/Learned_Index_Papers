    "abstract": "We address the fundamental task of inferring cross-document coreference and hierarchy in scientific texts, which has important applications in knowledge graph construction, search, recommendation and discovery. LLMs can struggle when faced with many long-tail technical concepts with nuanced variations. We present a novel method which generates context-dependent definitions of concept mentions by retrieving full-text literature, and uses the definitions to enhance detection of cross-document relations. We further generate relational definitions, which describe how two concept mentions are related or different, and design an efficient re-ranking approach to address the combinatorial explosion involved in inferring links across papers. In both fine-tuning and in-context learning settings we achieve large gains in performance. We provide analysis of generated definitions, shedding light on the relational reasoning ability of LLMs over fine-grained scientific concepts.",
