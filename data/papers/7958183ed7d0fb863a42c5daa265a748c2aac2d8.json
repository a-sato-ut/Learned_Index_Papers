    "abstract": "This research offers a thorough bibliometric examination of machine learning (ML) in decision-making, emphasising its developing research landscape, principal contributors, thematic priorities, and new trends. Drawing on 188 peer-reviewed articles from the Scopus database, this research spans 1971-2025, showcasing two distinct documentation phases. Further, this study identifies the USA, China, and India as leading contributors, reflecting their robust R&D ecosystems and interdisciplinary collaborations. Using open-sourced tools like VOSviewer and R-Studios, the analysis uncovers six keyword clusters, emphasising applications in healthcare, finance, and commerce, along with emerging themes such as explainable AI and human-centric decision-making. This research provides actionable insights into the field's progression, offers a roadmap for future exploration, and highlights the importance of ethical and interdisciplinary approaches in leveraging ML for decision-making.",
