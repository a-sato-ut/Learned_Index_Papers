    "abstract": "As the number of cloud platforms supporting scientific research grows, there is an increasing need to support interoperability between two or more cloud platforms. A well accepted core concept is to make data in cloud platforms Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR). We introduce a companion concept that applies to cloud-based computing environments that we call a Secure and Authorized FAIR Environment (SAFE). SAFE environments require data and platform governance structures and are designed to support the interoperability of sensitive or controlled access data, such as biomedical data. A SAFE environment is a cloud platform that has been approved through a defined data and platform governance process as authorized to hold data from another cloud platform and exposes appropriate APIs for the two platforms to interoperate.",
