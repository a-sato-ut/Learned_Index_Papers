    "abstract": "Large-scale whole genome sequencing (WGS) studies and biobanks are rapidly generating a multitude of coding and non-coding variants. They provide an unprecedented resource for illuminating the genetic basis of human diseases. Variant functional annotations play a critical role in WGS analysis, result interpretation, and prioritization of disease- or trait-associated causal variants. Existing functional annotation databases have limited scope to perform online queries or are unable to functionally annotate the genotype data of large WGS studies and biobanks for downstream analysis. We develop the Functional Annotation of Variants Online Resources (FAVOR) to meet these pressing needs. FAVOR provides a comprehensive online multi-faceted portal with summarization and visualization of all possible 9 billion single nucleotide variants (SNVs) across the genome, and allows for rapid variant-, gene-, and region-level online queries. It integrates variant functional information from multiple sources to describe the functional characteristics of variants and facilitates prioritizing plausible causal variants influencing human phenotypes. Furthermore, a scalable annotation tool, FAVORannotator, is provided for functionally annotating and efficiently storing the genotype and variant functional annotation data of a large-scale sequencing study in an annotated GDS file format to facilitate downstream analysis. FAVOR and FAVORannotator are available at https://favor.genohub.org.",
