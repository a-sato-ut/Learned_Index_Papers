    "abstract": "The lane-changing decision-making is a great challenge in autonomous driving system, especially to judge the feasibility of lane-changing due to the randomness and complexity of surrounding traffic participants. Reinforcement learning has been shown to outperform many rule-based algorithm for some complex systems. In this paper, the single-step deep Q network algorithm is proposed by combining single-step reinforcement learning and deep Q network, and it is applied to judge the feasibility of lane-changing for autonomous vehicle. In a real-world-like and random traffic environment built in Carmaker, the trained agent can make correct judgment about the feasibility of lane-changing. Comparing the single-step deep Q network with the general deep Q network, although the general deep Q network can converge, there are still collisions, and the agent trained by single-step deep Q network is absolutely safe.",
