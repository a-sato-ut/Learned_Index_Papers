    "abstract": "QA matching is a popular research direction of NLP, but the current research on QA matching is focused more on short text matching. Generally speaking, the long text has more information than the general short text, but it is accompanied by more interference information, which leads to the decrease of generalization ability of the short text matching model in the long text matching task. This paper constructs the psychological counseling question answering database and verifies the long text QA matching methods based on deep learning. At the same time, we introduce Convolutional Neural Network to improve the Inference layer of ESIM (Enhanced Sequential Inference Model), so that it can better extract long text features to improve the inference analysis ability of the model. Experimental results show that the improved ESIM is effective in QA long text matching in psychological counseling.",
