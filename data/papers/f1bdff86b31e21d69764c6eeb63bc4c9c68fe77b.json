    "abstract": "closed-loop automation is a critical component in NFV based network operation. Machine learning techniques including reinforcement learning can increase network efficiency through intelligent resource management and operation. This paper details a closed-loop optimization flow that consists of feature selection, traffic forecasting and deep reinforcement learning for dynamic frequency scaling in the context of vCMTS test system. The results demonstrate power saving by running workload at lower frequency while maintaining required service level agreement.",
