    "abstract": "Code semantics similarity can be used for many tasks such as code recommendation, automated software defect correction, and clone detection. Yet, the accuracy of such systems has not yet reached a level of general purpose reliability. To help address this, we present Machine Inferred Code Similarity (MISIM), a neural code semantics similarity system consisting of two core components: (i)MISIM uses a novel context-aware semantics structure, which was purpose-built to lift semantics from code syntax; (ii)MISIM uses an extensible neural code similarity scoring algorithm, which can be used for various neural network architectures with learned parameters. We compare MISIM to four state-of-the-art systems, including two additional hand-customized models, over 328K programs consisting of over 18 million lines of code. Our experiments show that MISIM has 8.08% better accuracy (using MAP@R) compared to the next best performing system.",
