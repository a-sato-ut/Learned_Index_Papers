    "abstract": "We study the formal semantics of non-volatile memory in the x86-TSO architecture. We show that while the explicit persist operations in the recent model of Raad et al. from POPL'20 only enforce order between writes to the non-volatile memory, it is equivalent, in terms of reachable states, to a model whose explicit persist operations mandate that prior writes are actually written to the non-volatile memory. The latter provides a novel model that is much closer to common developers' understanding of persistency semantics. We further introduce a simpler and stronger sequentially consistent persistency model, develop a sound mapping from this model to x86, and establish a data-race-freedom guarantee providing programmers with a safe programming discipline. Our operational models are accompanied with equivalent declarative formulations, which facilitate our formal arguments, and may prove useful for program verification under x86 persistency.",
