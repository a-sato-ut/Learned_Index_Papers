    "abstract": "Many of today’s applications need massive real-time data processing. In-memory database systems have become a good alternative for these requirements. These systems maintain the primary copy of the database in the main memory to achieve high throughput rates and low latency. However, a database in RAM is more vulnerable to failures than in traditional disk-oriented databases because of the memory volatility. DBMSs implement recovery activities (logging, checkpoint, and restart) for recovery proposes. Although the recovery component looks similar in disk- and memory-oriented systems, these systems differ dramatically in the way they implement their architectural components, such as data storage, indexing, concurrency control, query processing, durability, and recovery. This survey aims to provide a thorough review of in-memory database recovery techniques. To achieve this goal, we reviewed the main concepts of database recovery and architectural choices to implement an in-memory database system. Only then, we present the techniques to recover in-memory databases and discuss the recovery strategies of a representative sample of modern in-memory databases.",
