    "abstract": "While artificial intelligence evolves rapidly, intelligent information systems are making significant progress. The core of intelligent information systems is data and models. As a result, data quality and model quality are significant for ensuring the quality of intelligent information systems. However, traditional software testing methods can not adequately evaluate the quality of data and models. In this paper, we propose the data quality evaluation method and the model evaluation method. The experiment results show the two methods are effective.",
