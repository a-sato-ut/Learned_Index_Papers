    "abstract": "Mining of software engineering data have proved successful for reusability of components in software development. Artificial Intelligence improves a large application domain of software engineering activities. Intelligent knowledge discovery integrates Artificial Intelligence with Data Mining for intelligent computing of software engineering tasks. The integration of artificial intelligence with data mining for supporting software engineering applications leads to Software Intelligence. This paper analyzes three artificial intelligence techniques that uses data mining, business intelligence, machine learning for promoting automated software reuse for software construction and overall software development. The business intelligence tools are used for intelligent knowledge discovery of code that will be used for reusability of applications and components. An analysis of several AI techniques in software reuse domain of software engineering is discussed for automated software reuse and identification of potential research prospects in the field.",
