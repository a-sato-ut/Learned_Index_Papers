    "abstract": "Filters trade off accuracy for space and occasionally return false positive matches with a bounded error. Numerous systems use filters in fast memory to avoid performing expensive I/Os to slow storage. A fundamental limitation in traditional filters is that they do not change their representation upon seeing a false positive match. Therefore, the maximum false positive rate is only guaranteed for a single query, not for an arbitrary set of queries. We can improve the filter's performance on a stream of queries, especially on a skewed distribution, if we can adapt after encountering false positives. Adaptive filters, such as telescoping quotient filters and adaptive cuckoo filters, update their representation upon detecting a false positive to avoid repeating the same error in the future. Adaptive filters require an auxiliary structure, typically much larger than the main filter and often residing on slow storage, to facilitate adaptation. However, existing adaptive filters are not practical and have not been adopted in real-world systems for two main reasons. First, they offer weak adaptivity guarantees, meaning that fixing a new false positive can cause a previously fixed false positive to come back. Secondly, the sub-optimal design of the auxiliary structure results in adaptivity overheads so substantial that they can actually diminish overall system performance compared to a traditional filter. In this paper, we design and implement the \\sysname, the first practical adaptive filter with minimal adaptivity overhead and strong adaptivity guarantees, which means that the performance and false-positive guarantees continue to hold even for adversarial workloads. The \\sysname is based on the state-of-the-art quotient filter design and preserves all the critical features of the quotient filter such as cache efficiency and mergeability. Furthermore, we employ a new auxiliary structure design which results in considerably low adaptivity overhead and makes the \\sysname practical in real systems. We evaluate the \\sysname by using it to filter queries to an on-disk B-tree database and find no negative impact on insert or query performance compared to traditional filters. Against adversarial workloads, the \\sysname preserves system performance, whereas traditional filters incur 2× slowdown from adversaries representing as low as 1% of the workload. Finally, we show that on skewed query workloads, the \\sysname can reduce the false-positive rate 100× using negligible (1/1000th of a bit per item) space overhead.",
