    "abstract": "This paper introduces Heimdall, a highly accurate and efficient machine learning-powered I/O admission policy for flash storage, designed to operate in a black-box manner. We make domain-specific innovations in various ML stages by introducing accurate period-based labeling, 3-stage noise filtering, in-depth feature engineering, and fine-grained tuning, which together improve the decision accuracy from 67% up to 93%. We perform various deployment optimizations to reach a sub-μs inference latency and a small, 28KB, memory overhead. With 500 unbiased random experiments derived from production traces, we show Heimdall delivers 15-35% lower average I/O latency compared to the state of the art and up to 2x faster to a baseline. Heimdall is ready for user-level, in-kernel, and distributed deployments.",
