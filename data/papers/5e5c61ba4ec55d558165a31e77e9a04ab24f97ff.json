    "abstract": "This paper proposes a fast and nondisruptive reconfiguration algorithm for topology migration in optical datacom networks. The proposed algorithm models the dependency between links to be removed as conflict graphs (CGs) and jointly optimizes the reconfiguration speed and traffic disruption by iteratively solving the maximum clique problems with the CGs. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm can reduce the number of disrupted connections by ×74.5 with just 2.7 more reconfiguration stages on average compared with a baseline performing one-shot reconfiguration.",
