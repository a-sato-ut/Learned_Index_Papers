    "abstract": "The amount of available geospatial data grows at an ever faster pace. This leads to a constantly increasing demand for processing power and storage in order to provide data analysis in a timely manner. At the same time, a lot of geospatial processing is visual and exploratory in nature, thus having bounded precision requirements. We present DeepSPACE, a deep learning-based approximate geospatial query processing engine which combines modest hardware requirements with the ability to answer flexible aggregation queries while keeping the required state to a few hundred KiBs.",
