    "abstract": "The quality of a database design has a significant impact on the quality of an information system. Even if a system has been running for a long time, a programmer may forget to optimize a query in MySQL, even though optimization is critical as the amount of data is enormous. MySQL has an index function for tables that helps to speed up database searches. In essence, the index will be beneficial if utilized by the user's interests and wants; otherwise, the index, constructed randomly and in large quantities, would slow down database access. As a result, before constructing a database index, it is necessary to reconsider the rules and conduct a thorough examination.",
