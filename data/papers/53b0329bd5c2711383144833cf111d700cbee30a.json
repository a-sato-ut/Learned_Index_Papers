    "abstract": "Manual administrative processes often delay access to accurate academic and organizational policy information, causing inefficiencies. This study develops and evaluates a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) QA system leveraging GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.0 to produce precise, context-aware answers from both narrative texts and structured tables in PDF documents. Results show that GPT-4.0 raises answer correctness from 46.98 % to 57.12 % on tabular data and from 50.14 % to 55.20 % on narratives, improves faithfulness by approximately 0.11 on tables (0.6481 vs. 0.5369), and incurs only a one-second average latency increase (from 2.53 s to 3.53 s on tables). These concrete gains demonstrate that adopting a more capable generative model can significantly enhance the reliability and speed of policy-document question answering, ultimately streamlining information access in academic and organizational contexts.",
