    "abstract": "When selling goods abroad or bringing them into the country from foreign partners, we face the problem of delivery. The division of responsibilities related to this between the manufacturer and the recipient sometimes varies. In such a situation, it is reasonable to use the services of a forwarding company. Then a forwarding contract is concluded, which specifies the details of the service, but the most important issue remains the selection of its price. In this paper, we present results obtained using the LightGBM method on the forwarding contracts pricing challenge held as part of the FedCSIS 2022 conference.",
