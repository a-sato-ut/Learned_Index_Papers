    "abstract": "Enterprises are moving their business-critical workloads to public clouds at an accelerating pace. Multi-tenancy is a crucial tenet for cloud data service providers allowing them to provide services in cost-effective manner by sharing of resources among tenants of the service. In this tutorial we review architectures of today's cloud data services and identify trends and challenges that arise in multi-tenant cloud data services. We discuss techniques that have been developed for enabling elasticity, providing SLAs, ensuring performance isolation, and reducing cost. We conclude with open research problems in cloud data services.",
