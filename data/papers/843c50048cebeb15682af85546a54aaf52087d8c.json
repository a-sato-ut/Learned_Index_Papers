    "abstract": "This article addresses the problem of DB modeling in the emerging paradigm known as cloud computing. The study uses an ad hoc methodology to carry out Systematic Reviews in Software Engineering. The objective was to analyze primary studies carried out in the last decade around cloud computing, in particular, to synthesize knowledge about techniques, procedures and practices for data modeling, as well as quality criteria commonly used in systems that use this computational model. The findings allow to identity as main techniques or procedures: Data Encryption, Fragmentation, Load Balancing, among others; Likewise, the following could be identified as quality criteria: Security, Availability, Scalability, Elasticity, Performance.",
