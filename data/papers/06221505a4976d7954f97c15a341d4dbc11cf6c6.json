    "abstract": "This paper proposes a new universal linear transformation mechanism, inspired by the von Neumann-Morgenstern utility theory, known as the Von Neumann–Morgenstern Mechanism (VNM). This mechanism structurally reconstructs the linear layer in the neural network by introducing the \"utility transformation\" method to the traditional linear weights. Experiments on the image classification task CIFAR-10 have shown that the model using the VNM mechanism has obvious performance improvements over traditional methods in multiple evaluation indicators, showing stronger stability and generalization ability. This paper emphasizes that the mechanism has wide portability and is suitable for linear transformation modules in various neural network structures, providing a new idea for designing more effective deep learning models.",
