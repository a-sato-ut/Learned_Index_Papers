    "abstract": "Today’s world is most dependent upon computer systems. Artificial Intelligence is also growing rapidly. We can see that vast growing field in computer system is Artificial Intelligence. We can use artificial intelligence applications for program testing service. Old process contains errors and they are corrected by end user himself. Artificial Intelligence applications can be used directly and wait to provide inputs. In between if any errors are modified by the software. This research paper focuses on AI-PTS model. Artificial Intelligence applications itself corrects the errors and take the program to run-time. We use decision trees, searching patterns, database training grammar.",
