    "abstract": ": For many years, symbolic paradigms have dominated AI, but the impressive accomplishments of neural approaches have made them a new dominant paradigm. However, each of these paradigms has distinct advantages. This talk presents a hybrid paradigm that integrates case-based reasoning (CBR) with network methods to achieve the beneﬁts of both. CBR is a knowledge-based reasoning and learning methodology inspired by human cognition that adapts prior cases—records of prior experiences, to solve new problems. The CBR process supports efﬁcient knowledge-based reasoning and the reuse of structured or unstructured solutions; it is naturally interpretable, can learn from few examples, and provides inertia-free lazy learning. However, the success of CBR depends on similarity and case-adaptation knowledge, which may be hard to acquire. This talk presents opportunities for combining case-based reasoning with neural networks to leverage both paradigms.",
