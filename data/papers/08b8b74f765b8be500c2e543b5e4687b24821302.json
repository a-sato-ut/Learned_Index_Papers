    "abstract": "Optical switching technology is emerging as a solution to the limitations of traditional electronic switching. Combining optical switching with mode‐division multiplexing effectively overcomes the limitations of expanding switching capacity solely by increasing the number of ports. This paper introduces a compact four‐mode 2 × 2 optical switch and a four‐mode reconfigurable non‐blocking 4 × 4 optical switch matrix based on the Beneš architecture. The multimode 2 × 2 switch achieves an extinction ratio larger than 15 dB for all modes in the wavelength range of 1530–1590 nm. The multimode 4 × 4 switch matrix has an extinction ratio exceeding 9 dB for all modes and states in the C‐band, with a compact size (1.46 × 0.23 mm2) and low power consumption (0–154 mW). It supports high‐integrity 50 Gbaud PAM4 signal transmission with a bit error rate below the forward error correction limit. These devices pave the way for enhanced integration density and capacity in optical switching systems.",
