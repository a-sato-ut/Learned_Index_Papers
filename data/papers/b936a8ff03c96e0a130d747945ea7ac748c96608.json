    "abstract": "We study three classical online problems -- $k$-server, $k$-taxi, and chasing size $k$ sets -- through a lens of smoothed analysis. Our setting allows request locations to be adversarial up to small perturbations, interpolating between worst-case and average-case models. Specifically, we show that if the metric space is contained in a ball in any normed space and requests are drawn from distributions whose density functions are upper bounded by $1/\\sigma$ times the uniform density over the ball, then all three problems admit polylog$(k/\\sigma)$-competitive algorithms. Our approach is simple: it reduces smoothed instances to fully adversarial instances on finite metrics and leverages existing algorithms in a black-box manner. We also provide a lower bound showing that no algorithm can achieve a competitive ratio sub-polylogarithmic in $k/\\sigma$, matching our upper bounds up to the exponent of the polylogarithm. In contrast, the best known competitive ratios for these problems in the fully adversarial setting are $2k-1$, $\\infty$ and $\\Theta(k^2)$, respectively.",
