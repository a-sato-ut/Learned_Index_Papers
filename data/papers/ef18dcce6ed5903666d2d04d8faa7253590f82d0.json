    "abstract": "The soybean cyst nematode (SCN) is one of the most destructive pests affecting soybean production worldwide. Wild soybean (Glycine soja) germplasm offers valuable genetic resources for developing SCN-resistant cultivars. Here, we present a telomere-to-telomere assembly of the wild soybean Glycine soja accession YSD56, which is resistant to the highly virulent SCN race X12. The assembled genome has a total length of 1,008.52 Mb, with a contig N50 of 51.97 Mb, and successfully resolves all 20 centromeres and 40 telomeres. The assembly is high quality, with 99.7% completeness based on conserved single-copy orthologs (BUSCO) and a base-level accuracy of QV 52.16. A total of 57,712 protein-coding genes were predicted, 98.79% of which were functionally annotated. This high-quality reference genome provides a valuable resource for investigating SCN resistance and accelerating soybean genetic improvement.",
