    "abstract": "Sequence alignment is the first step of the bioinformatics pipelines for analyzing DNA sequences in genomics. As the DNA sequencer throughput is dramatically increasing, the pipeline bottleneck has now shifted to the massive amount of sequence alignment computation. GPU-based acceleration has emerged as a promising solution to this challenge, and several efforts have focused on accelerating core algorithmic components. However, when integrating existing GPU-accelerated components into BWA-MEM and Minimap2, two widely used tools for short and long reads respectively, we identify several unresolved issues. One could naively attempt to gather and/or fix those libraries, but such an approach would result in a severe slowdown despite non-trivial effort. To address these issues, we propose G3SA, the first GPU acceleration with efficient parallelization and optimization strategies for the end-to-end gold standard sequence alignment algorithms for short and long reads. We observe that the primary bottlenecks stem from irregular and redundant computation and memory access patterns. Therefore, we design our kernels to fully exploit the memory hierarchy and computational capabilities of GPUs, reducing costly computation and memory access. Furthermore, following the seed-chain-extend flow of standard sequence alignment algorithms, we propose techniques tailored to specific stages in the pipeline. Using these techniques, G3SA achieves significant end-to-end speedup against the CPU and GPU baselines.",
