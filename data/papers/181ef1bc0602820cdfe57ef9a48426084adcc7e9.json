    "abstract": "The system in construction project management is constantly improving and increasing, and the traditional method is no longer applicable to the nature of construction engineering management in the current industry, and it is of great practical significance to optimize its multi-objective system. In order to realize the multi-objective system optimization of construction project management, a multi-objective optimization system of construction project management based on K-means algorithm is designed and used, and multi-objective system optimization is carried out on this basis, and the K-means algorithm provided by NET is used for calculation on the basis of the framework system system, in order to open up the research of K-means algorithm in construction project management and provide a new reference basis and practice path for the multi-objective optimization system of construction project management.",
