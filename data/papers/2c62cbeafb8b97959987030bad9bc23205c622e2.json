    "abstract": "Machine learning algorithms have had a profound impact on the field of computer science over the past few decades. The performance of these algorithms heavily depends on the representations derived from the data during the learning process. Successful learning processes aim to produce concise, discrete, meaningful representations that can be effectively applied to various tasks. Recent advancements in deep learning models have proven to be highly effective in capturing high-dimensional, non-linear, and multi-modal characteristics. In this work, we provide a comprehensive overview of the current state-of-the-art in deep representation learning and the principles and developments made in the process of representation learning. Our study encompasses both supervised and unsupervised methods, including popular techniques such as autoencoders, self-supervised methods, and deep neural networks. Furthermore, we explore a wide range of applications, including image recognition and natural language processing. In addition, we discuss recent trends, key issues, and open challenges in the field. This survey endeavors to make a significant contribution to the field of deep representation learning, fostering its understanding and facilitating further advancements.",
