    "abstract": "To estimate item frequencies of data streams with limited space, sketches are widely used in real applications, including real-time web analytics, network monitoring, and self-driving. Sketches can be viewed as a model which maps the identifier of a stream item to the corresponding frequency domain. Starting from the premise, we envision a neural data structure, which we term the meta-sketch, to go beyond the basic structure of conventional sketches. The meta-sketch learns basic sketching abilities from meta-tasks constituted with synthetic datasets following Zipf distributions in the pre-training phase, and can be fast adapted to real (skewed) distributions in the adaption phase. Extensive experiments demonstrate the performance gains of the meta-sketch and offer insights into our proposals.",
