    "abstract": "Triangle counting plays a crucial role in graph computation, with widespread applications in social network analysis, community detection, and more. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis of triangle counting algorithms and, considering the characteristics of triangle counting, propose a method for triangle counting in streaming graphs. By leveraging the pre-update computation results, the updated graph data, and our TCSG (Triangle Counting in Streaming Graphs) algorithm, we can quickly compute the triangle count for the updated graph. We evaluated our Triangle Counting in Streaming Graphs (TCSG) algorithm using four real-world graphs. We tested the performance of TCSG with updates of 1K, 10K, 100K, and 1M edges. The results demonstrate that TCSG outperforms state-of-the-art systems, achieving speedup ranging from 1.294 to 124.185.",
