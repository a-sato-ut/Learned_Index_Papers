    "abstract": "Based on the relationship between client load and overall system performance, the authors propose a sample-aware deep deterministic policy gradient model. Specifically, they improve sample quality by filtering out sample noise caused by the fluctuations of client load, which accelerates the model convergence speed of the intelligent tuning system and improves the tuning effect. Also, the hardware resources and client load consumed by the database in the working process are added to the model for training. This can enhance the performance characterization ability of the model and improve the recommended parameters of the algorithm. Meanwhile, they propose an improved closed-loop distributed comprehensive training architecture of online and offline training to quickly obtain high-quality samples and improve the efficiency of parameter tuning. Experimental results show that the configuration parameters can make the performance of the database system better and shorten the tuning time.",
