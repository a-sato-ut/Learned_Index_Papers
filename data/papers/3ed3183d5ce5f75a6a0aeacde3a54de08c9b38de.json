    "abstract": ": The bike-sharing systems have been attracting increase research attention due to their great potential in developing smart and green cities. On the other hand, the mathematical aspects of their design and operation generate a lot of interesting challenges for researchers in the field of modeling, optimization and data mining. The mathematical apparatus that can be used to study bike sharing systems is not limited only to optimization methods, space-time analysis or predictive analytics. In this paper, we use temporal network methodology to identify stable trends and patterns in the operation of the bike sharing system using one of the largest bike-sharing framework CitiBike NYC as an example.",
