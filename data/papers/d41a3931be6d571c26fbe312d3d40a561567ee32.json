    "abstract": "Database accessibility can be challenging for users without technical expertise, particularly when generating SQL queries to retrieve information. This study addresses this gap by developing an OpenAI-powered system designed to automate SQL command generation, enabling non-expert users to interact with databases using natural language. Implemented as a web application, the system was evaluated by expert users, assessing both performance in query accuracy and user satisfaction. Results indicate high usability and satisfaction scores, with the system effectively enhancing accessibility to database functions, thus providing a user-friendly solution for database management.",
