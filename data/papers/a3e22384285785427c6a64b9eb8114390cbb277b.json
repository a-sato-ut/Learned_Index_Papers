    "abstract": "The continuously advancing digitization has provided answers to the bureaucratic problems faced by eGovernance services. This innovation led them to an era of automation it has broadened the attack surface and made them a popular target for cyber attacks. eGovernance services utilize internet, which is currently a location addressed system where whoever controls the location controls not only the content itself, but the integrity of that content, and the access to that content. We propose GLASS, a decentralised solution which combines the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) with Distributed Ledger technology and Smart Contracts to secure EGovernance services. We also create a testbed environment where we measure the IPFS performance.",
