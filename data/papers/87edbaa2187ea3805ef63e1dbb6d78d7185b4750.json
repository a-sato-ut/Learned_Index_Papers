    "abstract": "As Large Language Models (LLMs), including ChatGPT and analogous systems, continue to advance, their robust natural language processing capabilities and diverse applications have garnered considerable attention. Nonetheless, despite the increasing acknowledgment of the convergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Software Engineering (SE), there is a lack of studies involving the impact of this convergence on the practices and perceptions of software developers. Understanding how software developers perceive and engage with AI tools, such as ChatGPT, is essential for elucidating the impact and potential challenges of incorporating AI-driven tools in the software development process. In this paper, we conducted a survey with 207 software developers to understand the impact of ChatGPT on software quality, productivity, and job satisfaction. Furthermore, the study delves into developers' expectations regarding future adaptations of ChatGPT, concerns about potential job displacement, and perspectives on regulatory interventions.",
