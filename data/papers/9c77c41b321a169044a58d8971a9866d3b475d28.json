    "abstract": "A fundamental problem in data analysis is determining the frequency distribution of items within a data set. A count-min sketch is a widely used data structure that can estimate such a distribution. General purpose computation with graphics processing units (GPUs) has become increasingly prevalent over the last decade or so. A GPU provides much higher instruction throughput and memory bandwidth than a typical CPU. However, achieving maximum throughput on GPUs for count-min sketch is challenging, especially for large, uniformly distributed data sets, because each operation needs several random memory accesses that are slow and inefficient on GPUs. In this paper, we propose a suite of novel count-min sketch structures called QSketch. QSketch structures need only one coalesced memory access on average. We also present methods and algorithms to improve the accuracy without decreasing the searching performance. We implemented the QSketch with CUDA 11 and evaluated its performance and accuracy on various GPU platforms.",
