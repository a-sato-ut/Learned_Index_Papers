    "abstract": "Broad access to genomic data is leading to improving the understanding, prevention, and treatment of human diseases as never before. In this context, genome assembly is a fundamental yet time-consuming step to enable DNA analysis on a large scale. This process involves various phases, and among these, scaffolding is one of the most computationally intensive. The exact matching process of sequences accounts for more than 86% of the total runtime of such a phase. In this work, we present a scalable, high-performance, and energy-efficient FPGA-based architecture tailored to the exact alignment step of the scaffolding process. Specifically, we propose an in-drop replacement for Bowtie, a widely employed literature tool for scaffolding, outperforming it by 2309$\\times$ in speedup and 10443$\\times$ in energy efficiency. Likewise, our best architecture achieves speedups and energy efficiency improvements ranging from 1.37$\\times$ to 3364$\\times$ and 5.05$\\times$ to 7915$\\times$, respectively, when compared against hardware-based solutions in the State of the Art.",
