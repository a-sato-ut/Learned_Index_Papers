    "abstract": "Background The barriers to effective data analysis are sometimes insurmountable. Concerns ranging from privacy, security, and complexity can prevent researchers from using existing data analysis tools. Results JINet is a web browser-based platform intended to democratise access to advanced clinical and genomic data analysis software. It hosts numerous data analysis applications that are run in the safety of each User’s web browser, without the data ever leaving their machine. Conclusions JINet promotes collaboration, standardisation and reproducibility by sharing scripts rather than data and creating a self-sustaining community around it in which Users and data analysis tools Developers interact thanks to JINet’s interoperability primitives.
