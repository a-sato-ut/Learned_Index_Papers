    "abstract": "The research problem of how to use a high-speed circuit switch, typically an optical switch, to most effectively boost the switching capacity of a datacenter network, has been extensively studied. In this work, we focus on a different but related research problem that arises when multiple (say s) parallel circuit switches are used: How to best split a switching workload D into sub-workloads $D_1, D_2, ..., D_s$, and give them to the s switches as their respective workloads, so that the overall makespan of the parallel switching system is minimized? Computing such an optimal split is unfortunately NP-hard, since the circuit/optical switch incurs a nontrivial reconfiguration delay when the switch configuration has to change. In this work, we formulate a weaker form of this problem: How to minimize the total number of nonzero entries in $D_1, D_2, ..., D_s$ (so that the overall reconfiguration cost can be kept low), under the constraint that every row or column sum of D (which corresponds to the workload imposed on a sending or receiving rack respectively) is evenly split? Although this weaker problem is still NP-hard, we are able to design LESS, an approximation algorithm that has a low approximation ratio of only $1+ε$ in practice and a low computational complexity of only $O(m^2)$, where $m = \\|D\\|_0$ is the number of nonzero entries in D. Our simulation studies show that LESS results in excellent overall makespan performances under realistic datacenter traffic workloads and parameter settings.",
