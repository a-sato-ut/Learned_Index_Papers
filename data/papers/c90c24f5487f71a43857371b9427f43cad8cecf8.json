    "abstract": "Finding nearest neighbors in high-dimensional spaces is a fundamental operation in many diverse application domains. Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) is one of the most popular techniques for finding approximate nearest neighbor searches in high-dimensional spaces. The main benefits of LSH are its sub-linear query performance and theoretical guarantees on the query accuracy. In this survey paper, we provide a review of state-of-the-art LSH and Distributed LSH techniques. Most importantly, unlike any other prior survey, we present how Locality Sensitive Hashing is utilized in different application domains.",
