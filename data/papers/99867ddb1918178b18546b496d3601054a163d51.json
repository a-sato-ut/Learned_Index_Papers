    "abstract": "Key-value SSDs (KVSSDs) introduced so far are limited in their use as an alternative to the key-value store running on the host due to the following technical limitations. First, they were designed only for a single tenant, limiting the use of multiple tenants. Second, they mainly focused on designing indexes for primary key-based searches, without supporting various queries using a combination of primary key and non-primary attribute-based searches. This article proposes Cerberus, a Log Structured Merged (LSM) tree-based KVSSD armed with (1) namespace and performance isolation for multiple tenants in a multi-tenant environment and (2) capability for processing non-primary attribute-based search queries. Specifically, Cerberus identifies the tenant’s namespace and splits a single large LSM-tree into namespace-specific LSM-tree indexes for tenants. Cerberus also manages secondary LSM-tree indexes to enable non-primary attribute-based data access and fast search query processing. With the SSD-internal CPU/DRAM resources, Cerberus supports non-primary attribute-based search queries and handles complex queries that are combined with search and computing operations. We prototyped Cerberus on the Cosmos+ OpenSSD platform. When there are multiple tenants, Cerberus exhibits up to 2.9× higher read throughput and negligible write overhead compared to existing KVSSD. Cerberus also shows lower latency by up to 9.31× for non-primary attribute-based queries.",
