    "abstract": "This demonstration showcases Chestnut, a data layout generator for in-memory object-oriented database applications. Given an application and a memory budget, Chestnut generates a customized in-memory data layout and the corresponding query plans that are specialized for the application queries. Our demo will let users design and improve simple web applications using Chestnut. Users can view the Chestnut-generated data layouts using a custom visualization system, which will allow users to see how the application parameters affect Chestnut's design. Finally, users will be able to run queries generated by the application via the customized query plans generated by Chestnut or traditional relational query engines, and can compare the results and observe the speedup achieved by the Chestnut-generated query plans.",
