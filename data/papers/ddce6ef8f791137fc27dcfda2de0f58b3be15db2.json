    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) and additive manufacturing (AM) are both disruptive new technologies. AI has entered many aspects of our lives, but has not been fully realized in the world of AM. Because of the vast amount of data and the digital nature of the technology, AM offers tremendous opportunities in machine learning (ML) and consequently AI. This paper provides a vantage point view of the applications of ML and AI in AM, and specifically in powder bed AM technology. The types of data, sources of data, potential variabilities in experimental and simulation data, and the applicability of these data in ML algorithms are discussed. Several new ideas are presented where fusing these two transformative technologies can potentially have a profound impact on how AM is applied in different fields. A vision on the potential direction of AM to fully realize AI’s advantage is provided.",
