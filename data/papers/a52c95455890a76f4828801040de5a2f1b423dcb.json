    "abstract": "The growth in data volume poses a challenge to query processing. On the other hand, advancements in technology have made multicore CPUs available in many inexpensive servers. so parallel query based on multicore CPU is undoubtedly a solution for query acceleration and cost reduction. In this paper, a parallel query method is proposed and implemented, which rewrites the query execution plan and replaces the original serial scanning operator with a parallel driver operator under the premise that most of the operators do not change, so as to maximize the utilization of CPU and disk resources. Experiments show that it can achieve approximately a 2x speed increase in query processing.",
