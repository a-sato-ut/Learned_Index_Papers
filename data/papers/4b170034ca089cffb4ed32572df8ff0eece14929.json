    "abstract": "Process monitoring, fault detection, and diagnosis have become an essential element for both safety and economic operation, in the era of Industry 4.0 dominated by abundance of data. ML architectures like Artificial Neural Networks and Autoencoders have shown effectiveness in timely fault detection even in a complex non-linear system operation. However, interpretability of these black-box models is a critical challenge, leading to a major setback in operator usability and hence adopting these technologies in the industry floor. Recent advancements in ML have researched on addressing this issue using methods like SHAP. Yet, there is a dearth of studies showcasing the usability of such methods on real-life-real-time industrial setting. In this paper, a real time chiller operational data is studied for reliability and effectiveness of such a system. It was observed that the methods do provide reliable results and with effective visualizations, the operator traction to the solutions are possible.",
