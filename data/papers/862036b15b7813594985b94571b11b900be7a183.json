    "abstract": "Ranking models have achieved promising results, but it remains challenging to design personalized ranking systems to leverage user profiles and semantic representations between queries and documents. In this paper, we propose a topic-based personalized ranking model (TPRM) that integrates user topical profile with pretrained contextualized term representations to tailor the general document ranking list. Experiments on the real-world dataset demonstrate that TPRM outperforms state-of-the-art ad-hoc ranking models and personalized ranking models significantly.",
