    "abstract": "Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems traditionally separate transactional and analytical data into distinct layers, with transactional databases optimized for fast writes and analytical data warehouses for read-heavy queries. This separation introduces delays in analytics, hindering real-time insights and timely decision-making. Hybrid Transactional/Analytical Processing (HTAP) offers a unified solution by integrating Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) and Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) in a single system. This paper explores the feasibility of applying HTAP in CRM systems, highlighting its potential to enable real-time analytics, improve decision-making, and enhance business agility, while addressing associated challenges",
