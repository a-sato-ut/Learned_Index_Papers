    "abstract": "Database and Artificial Intelligence (AI) can benefit from each other. On one hand, AI can make database more intelligent (AI4DB). It is challenging for empirical database optimization techniques (e.g., configuration tuning, query optimization) to meet the high-performance requirement for large-scale database instances, various applications, diversified users. Learning-based techniques can alleviate this problem by exploring high-quality optimization strategies and reusing the historical data/models. On the other hand, database techniques can optimize AI models (DB4AI). AI is hard to deploy in real applications, because it requires developers to write complex codes and train complicated models. Database techniques can be used to reduce the complexity of using AI models, accelerate AI algorithms and provide AI capability inside databases. Thus, both DB4AI and AI4DB have been extensively studied recently.",
