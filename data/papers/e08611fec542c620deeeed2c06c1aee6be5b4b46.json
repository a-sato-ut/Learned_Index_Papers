    "abstract": "Named Data Networking (NDN) is developed to accommodate future-oriented internet traffic. In recent years, NDN’s popularity has grown due to the evolution of the Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, Cloud Services, and Blockchain. NDN’s key promising features are dynamic content management, privacy, mobility, and trust. This manuscript provides a comprehensive overview of the motivations and promises of NDN in the context of recent evolution technologies and applications. The recent reviews highlight the trend of NDN Blockchain and 5G technology with 73% of research interest, while transportation applications dominate 64% of the research interest. Afterward, we discuss existing NDN Architecture, Operation, Services, and applications, as well as the most popular NDN technologies. Our discussions are based on investigating current solutions with criticism. These significantly highlight the emergence of the NDN and the potential to revolutionize internet traffic management and security.",
