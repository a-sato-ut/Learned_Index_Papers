    "abstract": "Click-through rate (CTR) prediction is essential for optimizing ad targeting and enhancing personalized user experiences. Accurate CTR prediction improves ad relevance, boosts user engagement, and increases revenue. However, CTR prediction faces challenges in capturing dynamic user interests and complex feature interactions. This paper introduces a new model, the Attention-Gated Cross Network (AGCN), which combines the Deep & Cross Network (DCN) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) in a parallel structure to simultaneously handle feature interaction and user interest modeling. An attention mechanism within the GRU enhances user interest selection, assigning higher weights to behaviors more relevant to the target ad, thereby improving prediction accuracy.",
