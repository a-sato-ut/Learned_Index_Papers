    "abstract": "Most if not all on-line item-to-item recommendation systems rely on estimation of a distance like measure (rank) of similarity between items. For on-line recommendation systems, time sensitivity of this similarity measure is extremely important. We observe that recommendation\"recency\"can be straightforwardly and transparently maintained by iterative reduction of ranks of inactive items. The paper briefly summarizes algorithmic developments based on this self-explanatory observation. The basic idea behind this work is patented in a context of online recommendation systems.",
