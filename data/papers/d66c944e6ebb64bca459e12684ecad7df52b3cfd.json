    "abstract": "Low-rank approximation in data streams is a fundamental and significant task in computing science, machine learning and statistics. Multiple streaming algorithms have emerged over years and most of them are inspired by randomized algorithms, more specifically, sketching methods. However, many algorithms are not able to leverage information of data streams and consequently suffer from low accuracy. Existing data-driven methods improve accuracy but the training cost is expensive in practice. In this paper, from a subspace perspective, we propose a tensor-based sketching method for low-rank approximation of data streams. The proposed algorithm fully exploits the structure of data streams and obtains quasi-optimal sketching matrices by performing tensor decomposition on training data. A series of experiments are carried out and show that the proposed tensor-based method can be more accurate and much faster than the previous work.",
