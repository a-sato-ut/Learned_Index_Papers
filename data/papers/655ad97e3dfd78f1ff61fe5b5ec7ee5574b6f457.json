    "abstract": "When undertaking complex search scenarios within public digital libraries, users often face challenges in organizing found information. This is an important aspect in supporting exploratory search and cross-session search. In this paper, we present a novel public digital library search interface that includes nested workspaces and a generative AI approach to summarizing what has been saved in these workspaces. This semi-automatic approach to organizing found information was designed to support (1) metacognitive aspects of planning, monitoring, and evaluation during exploratory search and (2) task resumption during cross-session searching. Enhancing workspaces beyond simple collections of saved information holds promise for enabling searchers to more effectively make sense of what they have found while undertaking cross-session exploratory searches.",
