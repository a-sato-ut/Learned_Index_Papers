    "abstract": "Tree ensembles, random forests and gradient boosted trees, are useful in resource-limited machine learning deployments. However, traversing tree data structures is not cache friendly, which results in high latency during inference or regression. Tree traversal incurs random I/Os making inference memory bound. We present a system that trades many random I/Os for few sequential I/O by remapping a forest of trees into a single spatial index. It builds on the observation that each leaf in the forest encodes a hyperrectangle in the feature space. We make queries I/O efficient through pruning and space-filling curves. We then optimize computation through quantization of hyperrectangle boundaries and vectorization of enclosure queries. Our evaluation on a diverse set of benchmark datasets shows that the system reduces inference latency by 2 times in memory and 10 times for external memory with no detectable loss of accuracy.",
