    "abstract": "The widespread utilization of smart grids is due to their flexibility to support the two-way flow of electricity and data. The critical nature of smart grids evokes traditional network attacks. Due to the advantages of blockchains in terms of ensuring trustworthiness and security, a significant body of literature has been recently developed to secure smart grid operations. We categorize the blockchain applications in smart grid into three categories: energy trading, infrastructure management, and smart-grid operations management. This paper provides an extensive survey of these works and the different ways to utilize blockchains in smart grid in general. We propose an abstract system to overcome a critical cyberattack; namely, the fake data injection, as previous works did not consider such an attack.",
