    "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has gained significant attention in recent years for its potential to enhance natural language understanding and generation by combining large-scale retrieval systems with generative models. RAG leverages external knowledge sources, such as documents, databases, or structured data, to improve model performance and generate more accurate and contextually relevant outputs. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of RAG by examining its fundamental components, including retrieval mechanisms, generation processes, and the integration between the two. We discuss the key characteristics of RAG, such as its ability to augment generative models with dynamic external knowledge, and the challenges associated with aligning retrieved information with generative objectives. We also present a taxonomy that categorizes RAG methods, ranging from basic retrieval-augmented approaches to more advanced models incorporating multi-modal data and reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we review the evaluation benchmarks and datasets commonly used to assess RAG systems, along with a detailed exploration of its applications in fields such as question answering, summarization, and information retrieval. Finally, we highlight emerging research directions and opportunities for improving RAG systems, such as enhanced retrieval efficiency, model interpretability, and domain-specific adaptations. This paper concludes by outlining the prospects for RAG in addressing real-world challenges and its potential to drive further advancements in natural language processing.",
