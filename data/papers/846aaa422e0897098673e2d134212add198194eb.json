    "abstract": "Intelligent video surveillance technology is composed of the extremely complex algorithms and technologies. Hence, this article proposes a wireless sensor network intrusion detection model to perform real-time hazardous chemical monitoring. The video surveillance is mainly obtained through the on-site investigation process. After a preliminary understanding of the on-site situation, the “centripetal method” or “centrifugal method” is used to visit the periphery, and finally the surveillance video will be detected. To improve the security, the network intrusion detection model is employed. The performance is validated by testing the model under different conditions.",
