    "abstract": "Background: Multicultural education and second-language acquisition engaged neural networks, supporting executive function, memory, and social cognition in adulthood, represent powerful forms of brain-inspired multisensory learning. The neuroeducational framework integrates neuroscience with pedagogical practice to understand how linguistically and culturally rich environments drive neuroplasticity and cognitive adaptation in adult learners. Objective: This systematic review synthesizes findings from 80 studies examining neuroplasticity and cognitive outcomes in adults undergoing multicultural and second-language acquisition, focusing on underlying neural mechanisms and educational effectiveness. Methods: The analysis included randomized controlled trials and longitudinal studies employing diverse neuroimaging techniques (fMRI, MEG, DTI) to assess structural and functional brain network changes. Interventions varied in terms of immersion intensity (ranging from limited classroom contact to complete environmental immersion), multimodal approaches (integrating visual, auditory, and kinesthetic elements), feedback mechanisms (immediate vs. delayed, social vs. automated), and learning contexts (formal instruction, naturalistic acquisition, and technology-enhanced environments). Outcomes encompassed cognitive domains (executive function, working memory, attention) and socio-emotional processes (empathy, cultural adaptation). Results: Strong evidence demonstrates that multicultural and second-language acquisition induce specific neuroplastic adaptations, including enhanced connectivity between language and executive networks, increased cortical thickness in frontal–temporal regions, and white matter reorganization supporting processing efficiency. These neural changes are correlated with significant improvements in working memory, attentional control, and cognitive flexibility. Immersion intensity, multimodal design features, learning context, and individual differences, including age and sociocultural background, moderate the effectiveness of interventions across adult populations. Conclusions: Adult multicultural and second-language acquisition represents a biologically aligned educational approach that leverages natural neuroplastic mechanisms to enhance cognitive resilience. Findings support the design of interventions that engage integrated neural networks through rich, culturally relevant environments, with significant implications for cognitive health across the adult lifespan and for evidence-based educational practice.",
