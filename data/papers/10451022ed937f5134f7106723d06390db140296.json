    "abstract": "The Execute-Order-Validate (EOV) model of blockchain has significantly improved throughput compared to the Order-Execute (OE) model. However, existing systems following the EOV model still struggle to meet the required throughput levels in many applications. We address two critical performance bottlenecks that hinder their throughput: the high cost of transaction re-ordering and the high cost of re-execution of invalid transactions. To address these challenges, we propose HTFabric, a method that combines fast re-ordering and parallel re-execution to achieve exceptionally high successful throughput. We have implemented HTFabric based on Hyperledger Fabric. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that HTFabric outperforms SOTA systems by 2.34 to 10.51 times, achieving a successful throughput of up to 8,930 TPS.",
