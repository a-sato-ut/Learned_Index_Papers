    "abstract": "Count-Min Sketch with Conservative Updates (CMS-CU) is a popular algorithm to approximately count items’ appearances in a data stream. Despite CMS-CU’s widespread adoption, the theoretical analysis of its performance is still wanting because of its inherent difficulty. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to study CMS-CU and derive new upper bounds on both the expected value and the CCDF of the estimation error under an i.i",
