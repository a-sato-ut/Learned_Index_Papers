    "abstract": "Malware is a never-ending issue for business networks and personal devices. Nevertheless security-conscious consumers who employ up-to-date security solutions might fall victim to zero-day attacks. Furthermore, blacklisting-based methods suffer from false positives and false negatives. From here on, the concept of application whitelisting spread across security providers, and numerous solutions based on the same underlying technical concept emerged. In addition, whitelisting is used as a protective solution for emerging technologies such as industrial control systems and IoT systems. This research goes into depth on whitelisting techniques and algorithms to identify essential requirements based on whitelisting literature review and systems engineering concepts. It defines the requirements to build a powerful whitelisting system to be integrated into effective cyber defense solutions.",
