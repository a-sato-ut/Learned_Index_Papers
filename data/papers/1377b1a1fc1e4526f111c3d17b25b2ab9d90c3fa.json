    "abstract": "Abstract:This article argues for an additional interpretive layer in the pivotal scene of Plautus’s Mostellaria, during which the seruus callidus Tranio keeps the homecoming paterfamilias Theopropides out of his own house by inventing a haunting by a ghost named “Diapontius.” Plautus, I argue, characterizes Tranio as convincing Theopropides that he could subject him to curse magic: binding his spirit and conveying it to the gods of the Underworld. Comparison to the texts and sociological mechanisms of Greek and Latin curse tablets reveals undercurrents of binding magic in this already religiously and ritually freighted scene. Tranio presents himself as an expert magus; Tranio’s “Diapontius” has all the hallmarks of one of the restless dead, violently killed before his time and deprived of proper burial rites; and the effect on Theopropides matches both how Roman literature depicts victims of magic and what Greek and Roman binding spells themselves envision for their targets. This subtextual suggestion of curse magic is one more way in which Tranio displays his standing as a liminal character, and implies that we might read the ghost “Diapontius” as a cipher for Tranio’s perception of his own enslaved social status and bleak life situation.",
