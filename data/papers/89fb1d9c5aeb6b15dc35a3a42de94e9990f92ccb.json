    "abstract": "Transportation studies generate massive amounts of data that are difficult to store, process, query and visualize quickly and easily. Overcoming these challenges are an essential aspect of making the collected data useful to both the original study and other research that could build on the results. We explore the impact of database implementation, specifically IoTDB, on these aspects of data management with respect to transportation on existing datasets.",
