    "abstract": "Blockchain has become a popular paradigm for secure and immutable data storage. Despite its numerous applications across various fields, concerns regarding the user privacy and result integrity during data queries persist. Additionally, the need for rich query functionalities to harness the full potential of blockchain data remains an area ripe for exploration. In order to address these challenges, our paper first utilizes a framework based on the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) and oblivious RAM technique to achieve both privacy and data integrity. To enhance the query efficiency over the entire blockchain, we then devise a two-level learned indexing methodology named TELEX within the TEE for both integer and string keys. We also propose different query processing algorithms for versatile query types, including exact queries, aggregate queries, Boolean queries, and range queries. By implementing the prototype and conducting extensive evaluation, we demonstrate the feasibility and remarkable improvement in efficiency compared to existing solutions.",
