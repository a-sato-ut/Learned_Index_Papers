    "abstract": "Wide-area scaling trends require new approaches to Internet Protocol (IP) lookup, enabled by modern networking chips such as Intel Tofino, AMD Pensando, and Nvidia BlueField, which provide substantial ternary content-addressable memory (TCAM) and static random-access memory (SRAM). However, designing and evaluating scalable algorithms for these chips is challenging due to hardware-level constraints. To address this, we introduce the CRAM (CAM+RAM) lens, a framework that combines a formal model for evaluating algorithms on modern network processors with a set of optimization idioms. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CRAM by designing and evaluating three new IP lookup schemes: RESAIL, BSIC, and MashUp. RESAIL enables Tofino-2 to scale to 2.25 million IPv4 prefixes$\\unicode{x2014}$likely sufficient for the next decade$\\unicode{x2014}$while a pure TCAM approach supports only 250k prefixes, just 27% of the current global IPv4 routing table. Similarly, BSIC scales to 390k IPv6 prefixes on Tofino-2, supporting 3.2 times as many prefixes as a pure TCAM implementation. In contrast, existing state-of-the-art algorithms, SAIL for IPv4 and Hi-BST for IPv6, scale to considerably smaller sizes on Tofino-2.",
