    "abstract": "We present several methods for estimating the result cardinality of single table queries with a having clause. More specifically, we provide cardinality estimates for predicates using the aggregate functions count(*), sum(B), avg(B), min(B), and max(B). We do so for queries with and without a where-clause. Finally, we show how to handle conjunctions and disjunctions in the having-clause.",
