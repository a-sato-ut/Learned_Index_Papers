    "abstract": "In this study, the effectiveness and characteristics of three ranking methods were investigated based on their performance in ranking European football teams. The investigated methods were the Thurstone method with ties, the analytic hierarchy process with logarithmic least squares method, and the RankNet neural network. The methods were analyzed in both complete and incomplete comparison tasks. The ranking based on complete comparison was performed on match results of national leagues, where each team had match results against all the other teams. In the incomplete comparison case, in addition to the national league results, only a few match results from international cups were available to determine the aggregated ranking of the teams playing in the top five European leagues. The rankings produced by the ranking methods were compared with each other, with the official national rankings, and with the UEFA club coefficient rankings. In addition, the correlation between the aggregated rankings and the Transfermarkt financial ranking was also examined for the sake of interest.",
