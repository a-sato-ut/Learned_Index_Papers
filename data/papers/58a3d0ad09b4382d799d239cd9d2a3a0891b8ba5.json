    "abstract": "In recent years, more and more data have been generated via news media on Internet. Especially, when tremendous notable events happen at home and abroad, which cases a large demand for event retrieval. Text retrieval is the fundamental and important issue to search information under the scenario of Big Data Some recent works have proposed neural information retrieval, which has a significant improvement in terms of some problems (e.g., semantic gap). However, such retrieval takes a general-purposed query rather than event-oriented query as the retrieval object, which fails to search events in the event-oriented text retrieval scenaiio. As such, in this paper, we first analyze the difficulties and investigate a large of recent deep neural methods that may be used for event-oriented text retrieval. After that, we propose a pipeline based on deep neural networks. Finally, we present several tasks at different pipeline stages for evaluating event oriented text retrieval.",
