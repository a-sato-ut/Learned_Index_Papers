    "abstract": "With the ever-increasing hardware design complexity comes the realization that efforts required for hardware verification increase at an even faster rate. Driven by the push from the desired verification productivity boost and the pull from leap-ahead capabilities of machine learning (ML), recent years have witnessed the emergence of exploiting ML-based techniques to improve the efficiency of hardware verification. In this article, we present a panoramic view of how ML-based techniques are embraced in hardware design verification, from formal verification to simulation-based verification, from academia to industry, and from current progress to future prospects. We envision that the adoption of ML-based techniques will pave the road for more scalable, more intelligent, and more productive hardware verification.",
