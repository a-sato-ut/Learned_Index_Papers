    "abstract": "High-speed programmable data planes (e.g., P4 switches, smartNICs) have enabled fast, accurate, data-driven network management systems. Such systems leverage the packet-processing capabilities of the data plane and implement algorithms that continuously monitor traffic and actuate data-driven responses. Despite the performance and cost benefits, such systems expose a larger attack surface, which can be exploited through targeted attacks. In this paper, we present possible DoS-like attacks on data-driven network management systems built on top of programmable data planes. We discuss general countermeasures and highlight promising approaches to detect and defend against such attacks.",
