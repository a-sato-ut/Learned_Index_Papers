    "abstract": "We present the design and prototyping of a framework to support multicast for remote direct memory accesses (RDMA), specifically the one-sided WRITE operation. We use P4 programmable hardware to augment fixed-function RDMA transport hardware found on commodity NICs to enable one-sided RDMA multicast with zero-CPU overhead. Finally, we outline the potential challenges and future directions in realizing the framework for large-scale data center deployments.",
