    "abstract": "Digital media art differs from other forms of existence in the intersection of digital technology and art, and this new form of existence contains its unique value. Digital media art education crosses the disciplines of art, computer science, and technology and builds a new perspective that can encompass the academic discourse of literature and science, transcending the opposition between scientific and humanistic cultures and creating a broader knowledge structure and a new view of values and resources. In this paper, we use image quality evaluation based on local Gaussian weighted fusion and image collocation for restoration of precious cultural relics and images to realize their cultural values, in view of the current problems such as damage caused by a large number of precious paintings due to improper preservation and other problems.",
