    "abstract": "This study pioneers the integration of materials science and environmental aesthetics to advance eco-friendly art installation design, addressing the dual challenge of artistic innovation and ecological responsibility. Through empirical analysis of five sustainable materials (e.g., mycelium composites, recycled carbon fiber) and ten international case studies, we demonstrate how lifecycle assessments (LCA), modular design strategies, and dynamic material interactivity reduce carbon footprints by up to 35% while enhancing public engagement. Key findings reveal critical trade-offs: biodegradable materials exhibit low emissions but limited durability, while smart responsive alloys enable high interactivity (65% social media sharing) yet pose energy dependencies. The research bridges environmental informatics and aesthetic theory, proposing digital tools (AR/VR simulation) and interdisciplinary collaboration to transform art installations into active ecological agents.",
