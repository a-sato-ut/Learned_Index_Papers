    "abstract": "As deep neural networks require tremendous amount of computation and memory, analog computing with emerging memory devices is a promising alternative to digital computing for edge devices. However, because of the increasing simulation time for analog computing system, it has not been explored. To overcome this issue, analytically approximated simulators are developed, but these models are inaccurate and narrow down the options for peripheral circuits for multiply-accumulate operation (MAC). In this sense, we propose a methodology, SEMULATOR (SiMULATOR by Emulating the analog computing block) which uses a deep neural network to emulate the behavior of crossbar-based analog computing system. With the proposed neural architecture, we experimentally and theoretically shows that it emulates a MAC unit for neural computation. In addition, the simulation time is incomparably reduced when it compared to the circuit simulators such as SPICE.",
