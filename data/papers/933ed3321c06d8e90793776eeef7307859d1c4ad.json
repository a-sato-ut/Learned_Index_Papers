    "abstract": "We present a quantum-based approach for the optimization of join orders in database applications. Our approach relies on a hybrid framework, where classical heuristics are combined with a quantum processor to accelerate the search over the set of solutions to a constrained problem. By taking advantage of a previously introduced formulation of the join order optimization as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem, we implement it using the Constrained Quadratic Model (CQM), a hybrid classical-quantum solver that interfaces classical heuristics with D-Wave’s quantum annealer. We show that even a generic implementation of this classical-quantum hybrid framework produces competitive results for the join order problem, suggesting that better-tailored hybrid solvers could produce a computational advantage.",
