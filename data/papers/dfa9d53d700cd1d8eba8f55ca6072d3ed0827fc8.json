    "abstract": "The iterative nature of agile requirements engineering often requires considerable time and effort. Research on automation processes with artificial intelligence for agile requirements engineering practices has gained popularity in recent years. The objective of this study is to conduct a systematic literature review and report the current state of artificial intelligence integration in agile requirements engineering. 24 papers were selected for the analysis. From the papers included in the study, it was found that the most popular requirements engineering activity currently being researched with artificial intelligence is requirement analysis and documentation, with natural language processing tools combined with machine learning as the most used artificial intelligence tool. The levels of automation were still mostly at level 3 and level 4. Similar to related works, this indicates that the implementation of agile requirement engineering largely depends on humans.",
