    "abstract": "Several well-studied online resource allocation problems can be formulated in terms of infinite, increasing sequences of positive values, in which each element is associated with a corresponding allocation value. Examples include problems such as online bidding, searching for a hidden target on an unbounded line, and designing interruptible algorithms based on repeated executions. The performance of the online algorithm, in each of these problems, is measured by the competitive ratio, which describes the multiplicative performance loss due to the absence of full information on the instance. We study such competitive sequencing problems in a setting in which the online algorithm has some (potentially) erroneous information, expressed as a $k$-bit advice string, for some given $k$. We first consider the untrusted advice setting of [Angelopoulos et al, ITCS 2020], in which the objective is to quantify performance considering two extremes: either the advice is either error-free, or it is generated by a (malicious) adversary. Here, we show a Pareto-optimal solution, using a new approach for applying the functional-based lower-bound technique due to [Gal, Israel J. Math. 1972]. Next, we study a nascent noisy advice setting, in which a number of the advice bits may be erroneous; the exact error is unknown to the online algorithm, which only has access to a pessimistic estimate (i.e., an upper bound on this error). We give improved upper bounds, but also the first lower bound on the competitive ratio of an online problem in this setting. To this end, we combine ideas from robust query-based search in arrays, and fault-tolerant contract scheduling. Last, we demonstrate how to apply the above techniques in robust optimization without predictions, and discuss how they can be applicable in the context of more general online problems.",
