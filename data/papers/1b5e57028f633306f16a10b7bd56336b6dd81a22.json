    "abstract": "This review looks at the advancements in shipping-related air pollution prevention in the context of ship life cycle assessment and energy efficiency. It discusses which design option is best for implementing various strategies to lower greenhouse gas emissions. It covers logistics, digitization, environmental requirements, and the greenhouse gases produced. Among the issues for enhancing the propulsion system’s performance are air lubrication, ship hull optimization, and hull and propeller maintenance and cleaning. Alternative fuels, wind-assisted propulsion, and nuclear energy are given special attention. Energy-efficient design solutions, risk-based environmental ship design, and retrofitting older ships to improve energy efficiency are also covered. Several trends and recommendations for lowering shipping-related air pollution have been found in the review.",
