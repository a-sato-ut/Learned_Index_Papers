    "abstract": "With today's data deluge, approximate filters are particularly attractive to avoid expensive operations like remote data/disk accesses. Among the many filter variants available, it is non-trivial to find the most suitable one and its optimal configuration for a specific use-case. We provide open-source implementations for the most relevant filters (Bloom, Cuckoo, Morton, and Xor filters) and compare them in four key dimensions: the false-positive rate, space consumption, build, and lookup throughput.\n We improve upon existing state-of-the-art implementations with a new optimization, radix partitioning, which boosts the build and lookup throughput for large filters by up to 9x and 5x. Our in-depth evaluation first studies the impact of all available optimizations separately before combining them to determine the optimal filter for specific use-cases. While register-blocked Bloom filters offer the highest throughput, the new Xor filters are best suited when optimizing for small filter sizes or low false-positive rates.",
