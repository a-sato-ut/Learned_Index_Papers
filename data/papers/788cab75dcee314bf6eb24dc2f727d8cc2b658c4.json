    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence in Software Engineering is the hottest trend in the rapidly growing software world. AI techniques are powerful and easy to use as it can be easily deployed as key components of the system. The fusion of both these techniques emerges four new innovative research areas which require extensive research in the future. The application of AI techniques in the Software Engineering field poses many opportunities and risks for software organizations and handling these issues is essential before the selection of appropriate techniques. In this paper, we present an introduction, new emerging fields with the fusion of Artificial Intelligence with Software Engineering, challenges, and a conclusion.",
