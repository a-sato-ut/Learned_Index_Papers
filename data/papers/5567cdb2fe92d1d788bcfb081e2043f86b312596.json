    "abstract": "Abstract:This essay examines three social contexts that generate catharsis in Aristotle's Politics 8 and Poetics: (1) the Dionysian and Corybantic mystery rites, (2) performances of tragedies at the theatre, and (3) private readings of tragedies. These contexts attracted different groups of people: mostly women in #1; mostly non-aristocrats in #2; and mostly aristocratic males in #3. In context #1, initiates dancing to sacred aulos music at the mystery rites experienced \"healing and catharsis.\" In #2, an audience member hearing the music in a tragic performance has \"a kind of\" catharsis. In #3, reading the script of a tragedy generates catharsis. Does dancing to/listening to music bring about the same kind of catharsis as reading a tragedy? Do the women, non-aristocrats, and elite males in the three groups have the same experience of catharsis?",
