    "abstract": "The Bloom filter is a hash-based data structure that facilitates membership querying. Computation speed of Bloom filter is affected by hash functions that produce hash outputs. Basically, two operations: 'add' and 'query', consists of the Bloom filter. Previous researches have shown advanced computation speed of Bloom filter since the standard Bloom Filter is published. For example, Double Hash Bloom filter, Single Hash Bloom filter, etc. We propose a system that uses less computation than previous works with similar false positive and which is implemented by using a circular bit shift. This method was implemented with faster calculation speed, compared with previous works. Furthermore, experiments which were compared with previous researches and standard Bloom filter. Therefore, we demonstrate that the proposed system computes faster than previous studies with similar false positive rate.",
