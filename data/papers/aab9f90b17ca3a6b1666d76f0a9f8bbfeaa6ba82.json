    "abstract": "In this paper we present our findings in IT job market analysis and share our ideas of how they could be applied for designing new software development educational programs. This is relevant the current situation, when university programs cannot keep up with the changes in technologies and skills that employers require, also be constrained by Russian professional standards. To solve the problem of compatibility of educational programs with labor market requirements, we propose to create flexible educational programs based on the most common competencies in the most popular professions found in IT job advertisements. In total, we analyzed about 380000 IT vacancies for 2021-2022 downloaded from HeadHunter, the top Russian job website. The paper describes our results in classification of software engineering skills extracted from the job ads, and how one can apply these results for teaching new professions based on these skills.",
