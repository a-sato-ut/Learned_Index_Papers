    "abstract": "Machine learning has recently been deployed in many areas of processor design with promising results. This paper presents novel capabilities that enable exploration of design flow customisation involving machine learning adoption for customisable processor architectures. We introduce Orbit-ML, an approach that supports customisation of design flow for parametric architecture descriptions to allow experiments with machine learning techniques for optimising processor designs. Orbit-ML facilitates exploring domain-specific design flow with various tools such as design space exploration, source-level transformation, high-level synthesis, and static and dynamic optimisations. Our Orbit-ML prototype illustrates a customised design flow targeting a tunable processor, showing that Bayesian learning can find optimised designs by traversing only 4% of the total design space.",
