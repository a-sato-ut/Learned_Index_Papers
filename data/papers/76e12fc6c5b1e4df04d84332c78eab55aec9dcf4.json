    "abstract": "ChatGPT shows the enormous potential of large language models (LLMs). These models can easily reach the size of billions of parameters and create training difficulties for the majority. We propose a paradigm to train LLMs using distributed in-network computation on routers. Our preliminary result shows that our design allows LLMs to be trained at a reasonable learning rate without demanding extensive GPU resources.",
