    "abstract": "Couchbase Capella is a scalable document-oriented database service in the cloud. Its existing Capella Operational service is based on a shared-nothing architecture and supports high volumes of low-latency queries and updates for JSON documents. Its new Capella Columnar cloud service complements the Operational service. The Capella Columnar service supports complex analytical queries (e.g., ad hoc joins and aggregations) over large collections of JSON documents that can originate from a variety of Couchbase and non-Couchbase data sources and formats and can either be stored and managed by the Capella Columnar service or externally stored and accessed on demand at query time. This paper describes the new Capella Columnar service, looking both over and under the hood.",
