    "abstract": "Generative retrieval shed light on a new paradigm of document retrieval, aiming to directly generate the identifier of a relevant document for a query. While it takes advantage of bypassing the construction of auxiliary index structures, existing studies face two significant challenges: (i) the discrepancy between the knowledge of pre-trained language models and identifiers and (ii) the gap between training and inference that poses difficulty in learning to rank. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel generative retrieval method, namely Generative retrieval via LExical iNdex learning (GLEN). For training, GLEN effectively exploits a dynamic lexical identifier using a two-phase index learning strategy, enabling it to learn meaningful lexical identifiers and relevance signals between queries and documents. For inference, GLEN utilizes collision-free inference, using identifier weights to rank documents without additional overhead. Experimental results prove that GLEN achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance against existing generative retrieval methods on various benchmark datasets, e.g., NQ320k, MS MARCO, and BEIR.
