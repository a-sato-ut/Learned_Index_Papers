    "abstract": "This paper presents an intelligent computational architecture designed to enhance the quality of higher education in an academic ecosystem. By integrating generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), complex systems, and blockchain technology, this architecture aims to invigorate formative research and optimize educational processes. The proposed architecture seeks to facilitate effective collaboration and enhance educational quality by modeling academic ecosystems as complex networks and using smart contracts for intellectual property management, coupled with the incorporation of participation incentives through blockchain-based social tokens. The resulting architecture employs autonomous agents to propose projects and automatically recruit participants by combining complex networks with GenAI, preserving intellectual property via blockchain and managing incentives with social tokens.",
