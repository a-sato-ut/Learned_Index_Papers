    "abstract": "5G advancements like Massive Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) bring high capacity and low latency, but also intensify interference challenges. Static and dynamic coordination techniques address this, often at the cost of increased power draw. We introduce Cookie-Jar (CJ), an interference coordination (IC) framework using reinforcement learning for multi-goal optimization. By dynamically adjusting network, power, and topology parameters based on realtime conditions, CJ improves Signal to Noise and Interference Ratio (SINR) while minimizing power consumption. Simulated 5G experiments showcase CJ's potential, achieving a 15% SINR improvement with near-identical power draw compared to existing methods.",
