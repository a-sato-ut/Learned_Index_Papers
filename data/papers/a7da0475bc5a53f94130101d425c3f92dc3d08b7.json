    "abstract": "Production systems use heuristics because they are faster or scale better than the corresponding optimal algorithms. Yet, practitioners are often unaware of how worse off a heuristic's solution may be with respect to the optimum in realistic scenarios. Leveraging two-stage games and convex optimization, we present a provable framework that unveils settings where a given heuristic underperforms.",
