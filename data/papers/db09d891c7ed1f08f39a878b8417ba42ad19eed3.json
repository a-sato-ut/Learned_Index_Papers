    "abstract": "We consider the problem of designing prior-free revenue-maximizing mechanisms for allocating items to n buyers when the mechanism is additionally provided with an estimate for the optimal welfare (which is guaranteed to be correct to within a multiplicative factor of 1/α). In the digital goods setting (where we can allocate items to an arbitrary subset of the buyers), we demonstrate a mechanism that achieves revenue that is O(log n/α)-competitive with the optimal welfare. In the public goods setting (where we either must allocate the item to all buyers or to no buyers), we demonstrate a mechanism which is O(n log 1/α) competitive. In both settings, we show the dependence on α and n is tight. Finally, we discuss generalizations to broader classes of allocation constraints.",
