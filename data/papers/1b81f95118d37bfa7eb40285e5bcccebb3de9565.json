    "abstract": "Simple Summary Supernumerary teats (SNTs) refer to developmental anomalies that occur during the embryonic period and are commonly found around the mammary line. We performed a genome-wide selective sweep analysis on 37 goats using copy number variants, and identified multiple genes involved in embryonic mammary gland development and the biological process of breast cancer. Our findings can be used as a reference for the further investigation of SNT phenotypic candidate genes.",
