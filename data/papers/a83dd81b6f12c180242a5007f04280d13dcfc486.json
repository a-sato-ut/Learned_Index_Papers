    "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel use of Belief-Desire-Intention agents in Information Retrieval. We present a cognitive agent that builds its beliefs about the user’s knowledge during his/her interaction with the search system. The agent reasons about those beliefs and derives new ones using contextual rules. Those beliefs serve to personalise the search results accordingly. The framework is developed using an extended version of the Jason agent programming language; the choice of Jason’s extension to model the agents is justified by some of its advantageous features, in particular, the possibility to represent gradual beliefs. A running example will illustrate the presented work and highlight its added value.",
