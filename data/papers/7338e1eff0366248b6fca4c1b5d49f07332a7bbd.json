    "abstract": "In recent years, the web browser has taken over many roles of the traditional operating system, such as acting as a host platform for web applications. Web browser storage, where the web applications can save data locally was one of the new functionalities added in HTML5. However, web functionality has increased significantly since HTML5 was introduced. As web functionality increased, so did the threats facing web users. One of the most prevalent threats was the user’s privacy violations. This study examines the existing security issues related to the usage of web browser storage and proposes a new model to secure the data saved in the browser’s storage. The model was designed and implemented as a web browser extension to secure the saved data. The model was experimentally demonstrated and the result was evaluated.",
