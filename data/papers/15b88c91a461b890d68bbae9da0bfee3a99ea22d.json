    "abstract": "The increased demand for user-friendly data analytics emphasizes the difficulties experienced by non-technical users when searching and understanding database findings. We present a multi-agent data analytics system based on Large Language Models (LLMs), which includes agents for autonomous SQL query development, execution, and visualization using natural language input. Our modular, agent-based architecture provides seamless interactions between users and databases even without SQL knowledge. Experimental results show good accuracy in query construction and relevant data visualization. This study improves natural language database interfaces using integrated, automated visual analytics.",
