    "abstract": "Data processing on the smallest devices typically requires custom development as embedded databases such as SQLite require too many resources for use. This work develops EmbedDB, an embedded, key-value database optimized for memory-constrained devices and time series analysis. Experimental results demonstrate that EmbedDB is 5 times faster on a Raspberry Pi for time series query processing and runs with high performance on Arduino-based systems that SQLite and other previous systems cannot.",
