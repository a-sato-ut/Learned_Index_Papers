    "abstract": "We propose a novel type of nonlinear solver acceleration for systems of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) that is based on online/adaptive learning. It is applied in the context of multiphase flow in porous media. The proposed method rely on four pillars: (i) dimensionless numbers as input parameters for the machine learning model, (ii) simplified numerical model (two-dimensional) for the offline training, (iii) dynamic control of a nonlinear solver tuning parameter (numerical relaxation), (iv) and online learning for real-time improvement of the machine learning model. This strategy decreases the number of nonlinear iterations by dynamically modifying a single global parameter, the relaxation factor, and by adaptively learning the attributes of each numerical model on-the-run. Furthermore, this work performs a sensitivity study in the dimensionless parameters (machine learning features), assess the efficacy of various machine learning models, demonstrate a decrease in nonlinear iterations using our method in more intricate, realistic three-dimensional models, and fully couple a machine learning model into an open-source multiphase flow simulator achieving up to 85\\% reduction in computational time.",
