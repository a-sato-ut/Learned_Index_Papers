    "abstract": "Modern data centers suffer from immense power consumption. As a result, data center operators have heavily invested in capacity scaling solutions, which dynamically deactivate servers if the demand is low and activate them again when the workload increases. We analyze a continuoustime model for capacity scaling, where the goal is to minimize the weighted sum of flow-time, switching cost, and power consumption in an online fashion. We propose a novel algorithm, called the Adaptive Balanced Capacity Scaling (ABCS) algorithm, that has access to black-box machine learning predictions. ABCS aims to adapt to the predictions and is also robust against unpredictable surges in the workload. In particular, we prove that the ABCS algorithm is (1 + \")-competitive if the predictions are accurate, and yet, it has a uniformly bounded competitive ratio even if the predictions are completely inaccurate.",
