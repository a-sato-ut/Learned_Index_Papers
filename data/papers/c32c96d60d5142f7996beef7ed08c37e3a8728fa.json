    "abstract": "Deep neural networks with the artificial intelligence on Machine Learning (ML) algorithms constitute the best design specifically to deal with vast amount of data for retail business. The limited research approach is referred towards reducing memory consumption on integrating ML algorithms on data management system. This paper proposed combining data management and deep neural networks, ideas to build systems, which vast amount data can share in the database system. Therefore, ML algorithm has a pattern with multi-hidden layer that can use to synthesis different decision within a minimum processing. Finally, system precede and follow a NoSQL layers of a model employs in-memory database compression techniques and executes data management challenges with large datasets successfully.",
