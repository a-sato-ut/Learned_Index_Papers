    "abstract": "Processor throughput has been continually growing over time; however, the same is not true for memory throughput, leading to a widened difference between actual and potential peak CPU performance. Prefetchers were suggested as a solution to this issue. Prefetchers often lower data/instruction access latency by predicting future data/instruction addresses to be accessed and aggressively fetch data/instructions from higher up in the memory hierarchy. There are usually more than one prefetcher at each cache level. Prefetchers are frequently designed indepen-dently of each other. Not all applications benefit from increase in prefetching depth, and as a result, may lead to decreased overall performance. In this manuscript, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)- based prefetch controller to tune the aggressiveness of a prefetcher in L2 cache memory. Improved performance has been observed since delays due to highly aggressive prefetchers are avoided.",
