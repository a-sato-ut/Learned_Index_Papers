    "abstract": "This paper comprises a discussion of the implementation of non-SAP systems in relation to SAP environments on AWS with emphasis on issue identification and best practices. Some primary topics for the conversation are middleware and integration platforms and tools, APIs, and data exchanging strategies, AWS Glue and Lambda. This paper reflects on architectural factors and security factors which are crucial for integration. It also offers insights into the modern technologies like Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain, serverless computing and their roles in future integration evolution. The results stress the need for coherence in integration to make it both run smoothly in terms of operations as well as strategically.",
