    "abstract": "Process discovery methods have obtained remarkable achievements in Process Mining, delivering comprehensible process models to enhance management capabilities. However, selecting the suitable method for a specific event log highly relies on human expertise, hindering its broad application. Solutions based on Meta-learning (MtL) have been promising for creating systems with reduced human assistance. This paper presents a MtL solution for recommending process discovery methods that maximize model quality according to complementary dimensions. Thanks to our MtL pipeline, it was possible to recommend a discovery method with 92% of accuracy using light-weight features that describe the event log. Our experimental analysis also provided significant insights on the importance of log features in generating recommendations, paving the way to a deeper understanding of the discovery algorithms.",
