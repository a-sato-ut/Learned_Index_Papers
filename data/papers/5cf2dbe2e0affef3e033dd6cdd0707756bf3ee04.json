    "abstract": "Context: Large Language Models (LLMs) enable automation of complex natural language processing across domains, but research on domain-specific applications like Finance remains limited. Objectives: This study explored open-source and commercial LLMs for financial report analysis and commentary generation, focusing on software engineering challenges in implementation. Methods: Using Design Science Research methodology, an exploratory case study iteratively designed and evaluated two LLM-based systems: one with local open-source models in a multi-agent workflow, another using commercial GPT-4o. Both were assessed through expert evaluation of real-world financial reporting use cases. Results: LLMs demonstrated strong potential for automating financial reporting tasks, but integration presented significant challenges. Iterative development revealed issues including prompt design, contextual dependency, and implementation trade-offs. Cloud-based models offered superior fluency and usability but raised data privacy and external dependency concerns. Local open-source models provided better data control and compliance but required substantially more engineering effort for reliability and usability. Conclusion: LLMs show strong potential for financial reporting automation, but successful integration requires careful attention to architecture, prompt design, and system reliability. Implementation success depends on addressing domain-specific challenges through tailored validation mechanisms and engineering strategies that balance accuracy, control, and compliance.",
