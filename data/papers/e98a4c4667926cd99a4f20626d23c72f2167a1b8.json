    "abstract": "Significance We introduce APACE, AlphaFold2 and advanced computing as a service, a computational framework that optimizes AlphaFold2 to run at scale in high-performance computing platforms, and which effectively handles this TB-size AI model and database. We showcase the use of APACE in the Delta and Polaris supercomputers to accelerate protein structure prediction for a variety of proteins, and demonstrate that using 200 ensembles distributed over 300 NVIDIA A100 GPUs, APACE reduces time-to-insight from days to minutes. This framework may be readily linked with self-driving laboratories to enable automated discovery at scale.",
