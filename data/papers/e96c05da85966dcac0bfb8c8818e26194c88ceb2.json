    "abstract": "In this paper, the effect of different noises on Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) modes recognition by convolution neural network (CNN). A dataset of halftone images with LG modes and noises was prepared during the study. It is shown that not only intensity but also type of noise has high influence on classification process. However, presence of noisy images in the training sample allows to increase the recognition accuracy from 50% to 100% in most cases.",
