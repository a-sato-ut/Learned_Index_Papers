    "abstract": "The software development life cycle (SDLC) is a structured process for delivering a high-quality product within a specified timeframe. Developing a cost-effective and efficient software product life cycle has always been a priority in software engineering, which can impact product quality. This study aims to provide an overview of the recent articles that focus on applying optimization techniques, mathematical models, and software cost estimation in the software development process and propose possible future directions. For the selected 29 studies, the development phase of the SDLC is most commonly focused on in studies. This emphasis highlights the pivotal role of optimization and mathematical modeling in enhancing software development efficiency.",
