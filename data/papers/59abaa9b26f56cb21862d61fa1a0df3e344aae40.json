    "abstract": "Abstract Complex systems are generating more and more high-dimensional data for which tensor analysis showed promising results by capturing complex correlation structures of data. Such data is often distributed among various sites creating challenges for developing data-driven models. Specifically, data privacy and security concerns have been exacerbated in recent years and drove the demand to store and analyze data at the edge of networks rather than sharing it with a centralized server. Federated learning frameworks have been introduced as a solution to these concerns. These frameworks allow local clients to learn local models and collaborate with others to develop a more generalizable aggregated model while handling data privacy issues. In this article, we propose a federated generalized scalar-on-tensor regression framework where multiple local tensor models are learned at the edge, and their parameters are shared with and updated by an aggregator. Experiments on synthetic data sets and two real-world data sets from agriculture and manufacturing domains show the superiority of our approach over several benchmarks.",
