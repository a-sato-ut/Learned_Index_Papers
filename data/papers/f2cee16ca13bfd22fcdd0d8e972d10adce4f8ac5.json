    "abstract": ": Since its debut on November 30, 2022, OpenAI's ChatGPT has rapidly transformed natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC). Leveraging Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) technology, ChatGPT offers cost-effective, efficient, and diverse content creation. Despite advancements like GPT-4, concerns about data security, algorithmic bias, and ethical issues persist, especially in social work. AI integration in social work presents challenges such as potential data breaches and weakened interpersonal connections, necessitating robust regulations and ethical guidelines. Addressing these issues requires strict data protection, diverse AI training datasets, and transparency in AI-driven decisions. By balancing technological integration with humanistic values, AI can enhance social work efficiency while maintaining essential human care and support. This ensures AI serves as a beneficial tool rather than replacing human contributions.",
