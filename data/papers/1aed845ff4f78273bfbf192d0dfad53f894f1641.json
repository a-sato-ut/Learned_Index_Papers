    "abstract": "\n This paper proposes Makex (MAKE senSE), a logic approach to explaining why a GNN-based model\n M\n (\n x, y\n ) recommends item\n y\n to user\n x.\n It proposes a class of Rules for ExPlanations, denoted as REPs and defined with a graph pattern\n Q\n and dependency X →\n M\n (\n x, y\n ), where\n X\n is a collection of predicates, and the model\n M\n (\n x, y\n ) is treated as the consequence of the rule. Intuitively, given\n M\n (\n x, y\n ), we discover pattern\n Q\n to identify relevant topology, and precondition\n X\n to disclose correlations, interactions and dependencies of vertex features; together they provide rationals behind prediction\n M\n (\n x, y\n ), identifying what features are decisive for\n M\n to make predictions and under what conditions the decision can be made. We (a) define REPs with 1-WL test, on which most GNN models for recommendation are based; (b) develop an algorithm for discovering REPs for\n M\n as global explanations, and (c) provide a top-\n k\n algorithm to compute top-ranked local explanations. Using real-life graphs, we empirically verify that Makex outperforms previous explanation methods in terms of fidelity, sparsity and efficiency.\n",
