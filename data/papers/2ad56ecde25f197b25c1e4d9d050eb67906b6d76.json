    "abstract": "A spanning tree T of graph G is a $\\rho$-approximate universal Steiner tree (UST) for root vertex r if, for any subset of vertices S containing r, the cost of the minimal subgraph of T connecting S is within a $\\rho$ factor of the minimum cost tree connecting S in G. Busch et al. (FOCS 2012) showed that every graph admits $2^{O(\\sqrt{\\log n})}$-approximate USTs by showing that USTs are equivalent to strong sparse partition hierarchies (up to poly-logs). Further, they posed poly-logarithmic USTs and strong sparse partition hierarchies as open questions.We settle these open questions by giving polynomial-time algorithms for computing both $O\\left(\\log ^{7} n\\right)$-approximate USTs and poly-logarithmic strong sparse partition hierarchies. We reduce the existence of these objects to the previously studied cluster aggregation problem and a class of well-separated point sets which we call dangling nets. For graphs with constant doubling dimension or constant pathwidth we obtain improved bounds by deriving $O(\\log n)$-approximate USTs and $O(1)$ strong sparse partition hierarchies. Our doubling dimension result is tight up to second order terms.",
