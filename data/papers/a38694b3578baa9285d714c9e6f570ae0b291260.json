    "abstract": "The most common data-structures for genome indexing exhibit a fundamental trade-off between memory footprint and performance. We present Ranger, a new indexing technique that is both memory efficient and fast, and integrate it into the popular Minimap2 tool. Ranger achieves almost identical end-to-end performance as the original Minimap2, while occupying up to 1.7× and 1.2× less memory. With a limited memory capacity, Ranger achieves up to 4.3× performance speedup compares to current indexing techniques.",
