    "abstract": "Cardinality Estimation over Knowledge Graphs (KG) is crucial for query optimization, yet remains a challenging task due to the semi-structured nature and complex correlations of data in typical KGs. In this work, we propose GNCE, a novel approach that leverages knowledge graph embeddings and Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to accurately predict the cardinality of conjunctive queries over KGs. GNCE first creates semantically meaningful embeddings for all entities in the KG, which are then used to learn a representation of a query using a GNN to estimate the cardinality of the query. We evaluate GNCE on several KGs in terms of q-Error and demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art approaches based on sampling, summaries, and (machine) learning in terms of estimation accuracy while also having a low execution time and few parameters. Additionally, we show that GNCE performs similarly well on real-world queries and can inductively generalize to unseen entities, making it suitable for use in dynamic query processing scenarios. Our proposed approach has the potential to significantly improve query optimization and related applications that rely on accurate cardinality estimates of conjunctive queries.",
