    "abstract": "Owing to the unprecedented capability in semantic understanding and logical reasoning, the pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have shown fantastic potential in developing the next-generation recommender systems (RSs). However, the static index paradigm adopted by current methods greatly restricts the utilization of LLMs capacity for recommendation, leading to not only the insufficient alignment between semantic and collaborative knowledge, but also the neglect of high-order user-item interaction patterns. In this paper, we propose Twin-Tower Dynamic Semantic Recommender (TTDS), the first generative RS which adopts dynamic semantic index paradigm, targeting at resolving the above problems simultaneously. To be more specific, we for the first time contrive a dynamic knowledge fusion framework which integrates a twin-tower semantic token generator into the LLM-based recommender, hierarchically allocating meaningful semantic index for items and users, and accordingly predicting the semantic index of target item. Furthermore, a dual-modality variational auto-encoder is proposed to facilitate multi-grained alignment between semantic and collaborative knowledge. Eventually, a series of novel tuning tasks specially customized for capturing high-order user-item interaction patterns are proposed to take advantages of user historical behavior. Extensive experiments across three public datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methodology in developing LLM-based generative RSs. The proposed TTDS recommender achieves an average improvement of 19.41% in Hit-Rate and 20.84% in NDCG metric, compared with the leading baseline methods.",
