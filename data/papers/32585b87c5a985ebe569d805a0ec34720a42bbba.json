    "abstract": "Building personalized recommender systems is a cornerstone of the modern data mining and applied machine learning (ML) community. Modern online platforms have a confluence of data including user-item interaction graphs, user and item-associated semantics (text, visual content, etc.), and metadata. Recent advancements in generative models and semantic encoders via large language models (LLMs), visual and audio encoders have significantly impacted research in relevant domains, enabling new directions in knowledge discovery and ability of models to better incorporate semantic context. This workshop bridges the research gap between the use of generative models and recommendation for personalized systems. We will focus on topics spanning the interplay between such models and conventional personalized systems.",
