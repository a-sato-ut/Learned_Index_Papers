    "abstract": "The growing demand for data-intensive decision support and the migration to multi-tenant infrastructures put databases under the stress of high analytical query load. The requirement for high throughput contradicts the traditional design of query-at-a-time databases that optimize queries for efficient serial execution. Sharing work across queries presents an opportunity to reduce the total cost of processing and therefore improve throughput with increasing query load. Systems can share work either by assessing all opportunities and restructuring batches of queries ahead of execution, or by inspecting opportunities in individual incoming queries at runtime: the former strategy scales poorly to large query counts, as it requires expensive sharing-aware optimization, whereas the latter detects only a subset of the opportunities. Both strategies fail to minimize the cost of processing for large and ad-hoc workloads. This paper presents RouLette, a specialized intelligent engine for multi-query execution that addresses, through runtime adaptation, the shortcomings of existing work-sharing strategies. RouLette scales by replacing sharing-aware optimization with adaptive query processing, and it chooses opportunities to explore and exploit by using reinforcement learning. RouLette also includes optimizations that reduce the adaptation overhead. RouLette increases throughput by 1.6-28.3x, compared to a state-of-the-art query-at-a-time engine, and up to 6.5x, compared to sharing-enabled prototypes, for multi-query workloads based on the schema of TPC-DS.",
