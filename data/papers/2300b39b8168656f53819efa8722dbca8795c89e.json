    "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have emerged as an effective approach to tackling real-world problems. However, like human-written software, DNNs can have bugs and can be attacked. To address this, research has explored a wide-range of algorithmic approaches to verify DNN behavior. In this work, we introduce NeuralSAT, a new verification approach that adapts the widely-used DPLL(T) algorithm used in modern SMT solvers. A key feature of SMT solvers is the use of conflict clause learning and search restart to scale verification. Unlike prior DNN verification approaches, NeuralSAT combines an abstraction-based deductive theory solver with clause learning and an evaluation clearly demonstrates the benefits of the approach on a set of challenging verification benchmarks.",
