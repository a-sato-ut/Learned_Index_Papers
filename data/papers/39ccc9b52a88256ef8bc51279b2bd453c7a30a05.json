    "abstract": "With the increasing rate of data generated by critical systems, estimating functions on streaming data has become essential. This demand has driven numerous advancements in algorithms designed to efficiently query and analyze one or more data streams while operating under memory constraints. The primary challenge arises from the rapid influx of new items, requiring algorithms that enable efficient incremental processing of streams in order to keep up. A prominent algorithm in this domain is the AMS sketch. Originally developed to estimate the second frequency moment of a data stream, it can also estimate the cardinality of the equi-join between two relations. Since then, two important advancements are the Count sketch, a method which significantly improves upon the sketch update time, and secondly, an extension of the AMS sketch to accommodate multi-join queries. However, combining the strengths of these methods to maintain sketches for multi-join queries while ensuring fast update times is a non-trivial task, and has remained an open problem for decades as highlighted in the existing literature. In this work, we successfully address this problem by introducing a novel sketching method which has fast updates, even for sketches capable of accurately estimating the cardinality of complex multi-join queries. We prove that our estimator is unbiased and has the same error guarantees as the AMS-based method. Our experimental results confirm the significant improvement in update time complexity, resulting in orders of magnitude faster estimates, with equal or better estimation accuracy.",
