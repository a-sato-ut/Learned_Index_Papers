    "abstract": "Advancements in data management platforms, coupled with the increasing volume and complexity of data generated daily, pose significant challenges for organizations in efficiently querying and analyzing this data. The data fabric architecture manages data, query, and analytics pipelines by leveraging distributed computing capabilities without moving data to a centralized location, and dynamically routes queries for optimal performance. Data fabric integrates a variety of data pipelines seamlessly, improving governance and reducing latency. The key purpose of a data fabric solution is to support evidence-based decision-making, especially when the evidence has to be collated and discovered from a large number of disparate data sources. In this paper, we present the background technologies of data fabric and the need for metadata and data orchestration to comprehend and develop applications on top of the data fabric.",
