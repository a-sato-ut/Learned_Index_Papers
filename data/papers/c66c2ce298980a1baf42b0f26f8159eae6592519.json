    "abstract": "Today, DNN inference is widely adopted, with numerous inference services being spawned from scratch across instances in scenarios such as spot serving, serverless scaling and edge computing, where frequent start-stops are required. In this work, we first delve into the inference workflow and uncover the origins of cold start when invoking a DNN model. Specifically, DNN execution is blocked by the kernel loading process to prepare the code object executing on GPU at the DL primitive library (e.g., cuDNN and MIOpen). To tackle this, we propose PASK, a kernel loading and reusing middleware to mitigate the widespread cold start issue. Unlike the reactive kernel scheduling policy used by existing frameworks, PASK adopts a proactive strategy to interleave code loading, kernel issuing and GPU computation to achieve higher hardware utilization. To further reduce the loading overhead, PASK recycles existing loaded kernels to accomplish the DNN operator, rather than introducing new kernels for every layer. Meanwhile, PASK categorically organizes the cached kernels to efficiently find the applicable kernel for reuse and thus minimize incurred runtime overhead. We implement and evaluate PASK atop of open source DNN inference engine and primitive library on off-the-shelf GPUs. Experiments demonstrate PASK is capable of alleviating the cold start overhead of popular DNN models with $5.62 \\times$ speedup on average.",
