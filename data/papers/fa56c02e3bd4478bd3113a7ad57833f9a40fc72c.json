    "abstract": "This experience report introduces the Cross-Functional AI Task Force (X-FAIT) framework to bridge the gap between strategic AI ambitions and operational execution within software-intensive organizations. Drawing from an Action Research case study at a global Swedish enterprise, we identify and address critical barriers such as departmental fragmentation, regulatory constraints, and organizational inertia that can impede successful AI transformation. X-FAIT employs force field analysis, executive sponsorship, cross-functional integration, and systematic risk assessment strategies to coordinate efforts across organizational boundaries, facilitating knowledge sharing and ensuring AI initiatives align with objectives. The framework provides both theoretical insights into AI-driven organizational transformation and practical guidance for software organizations aiming to effectively integrate AI into their daily workflows and, longer-term, products.",
