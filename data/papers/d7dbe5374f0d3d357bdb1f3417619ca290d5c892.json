    "abstract": "Steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) based brain-computer interface (BCI) has received considerable attention due to its high information transfer rate (ITR) and available quantity of targets. However, the performance of frequency identification methods heavily hinges on the amount of user calibration data and data length, which hinders the deployment in real-world applications. Recently, generative adversarial networks (GANs)-based data generation methods have been widely adopted to create synthetic electroencephalography data, holds promise to address these issues. In this paper, we proposed a GAN-based end-to-end signal transformation network for Time-window length Extension, termed as TEGAN. TEGAN transforms short-length SSVEP signals into long-length artificial SSVEP signals. Additionally, we introduced a two-stage training strategy and the LeCam-divergence regularization term to regularize the training process of GAN during the network implementation. The proposed TEGAN was evaluated on two public SSVEP datasets (a 4-class and 12-class dataset). With the assistance of TEGAN, the performance of traditional frequency recognition methods and deep learning-based methods have been significantly improved under limited calibration data. And the classification performance gap of various frequency recognition methods has been narrowed. This study substantiates the feasibility of the proposed method to extend the data length for short-time SSVEP signals for developing a high-performance BCI system. The proposed GAN-based methods have the great potential of shortening the calibration time and cutting down the budget for various real-world BCI-based applications.",
