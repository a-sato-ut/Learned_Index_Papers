    "abstract": "A surge of recent work has focused on analyzing the performance of algorithms guided by predictions, aiming to enhance their worst-case performance guarantees with improved guarantees when the predictions are accurate. This \"learning-augmented\" framework was recently also extended to mechanism design settings involving strategic agents and we provide an overview of these results.",
