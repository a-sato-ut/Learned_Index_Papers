    "abstract": "Perfect hashing is a special hashing function that maps each item to a unique location without collision, which enables the creation of a KV store with small and constant lookup time. Recent dynamic perfect hashing attains high load factor by increasing associativity, which impacts bandwidth and throughput. This paper proposes a novel dynamic perfect hashing index without sacrificing associativity, and uses it to devise an RDMA-based remote memory KV store called CuckooDuo. CuckooDuo simultaneously achieves high load factor, fast speed, minimal bandwidth, and efficient expansion without item movement. We theoretically analyze the properties of CuckooDuo, and implement it in an RDMA-network based testbed. The results show CuckooDuo achieves 1.9~17.6x smaller insertion latency and 9.0~18.5x smaller insertion bandwidth than prior works.",
