    "abstract": "Cost and cardinality estimation is vital to query optimizer, which can guide the query plan selection. However traditional empirical cost and cardinality estimation techniques cannot provide high-quality estimation, because they may not effectively capture the correlation between multiple tables. Recently the database community shows that the learning-based cardinality estimation is better than the empirical methods. However, existing learning-based methods have several limitations. Firstly, they focus on estimating the cardinality, but cannot estimate the cost. Secondly, they are either too heavy or hard to represent complicated structures, e.g., complex predicates.\n To address these challenges, we propose an effective end-to-end learning-based cost estimation framework based on a tree-structured model, which can estimate both cost and cardinality simultaneously. We propose effective feature extraction and encoding techniques, which consider both queries and physical operations in feature extraction. We embed these features into our tree-structured model. We propose an effective method to encode string values, which can improve the generalization ability for predicate matching. As it is prohibitively expensive to enumerate all string values, we design a patten-based method, which selects patterns to cover string values and utilizes the patterns to embed string values. We conducted experiments on real-world datasets and experimental results showed that our method outperformed baselines.",
