    "abstract": "This systematic literature review aims to investigate the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on the labour force in software engineering, with a particular focus on the skills needed for future software engineers, the impact of AI on the demand for software engineering skills, and the future of work for software engineers. The review identified 42 relevant publications through a comprehensive search strategy and analysed their findings. The results indicate that future software engineers will need to be competent in programming and have soft skills such as problem-solving and interpersonal communication. AI will have a significant impact on the software engineering workforce, with the potential to automate many jobs currently done by software engineers. The role of a software engineer is changing and will continue to change in the future, with AI-assisted software development posing challenges for the software engineering profession. The review suggests that the software engineering profession must adapt to the changing landscape to remain relevant and effective in the future.",
