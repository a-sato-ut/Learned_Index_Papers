    "abstract": "This study investigates how businesses in France can leverage artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to enhance marketing and customer engagement strategies. The research problem centers on integrating AI into these strategies, which impacts businesses by offering the potential for a competitive advantage while posing challenges related to data privacy, ethical considerations, and customer expectations. The study aims to provide actionable insights and practical recommendations for effectively leveraging AI, guided by a conceptual framework emphasizing ethical AI practices, transparency, and continuous innovation. The research employs an integrative literature review (ILR) methodology to synthesize existing literature and analyze the opportunities and challenges associated with AI integration. The methodology involves problem formulation; data collection, evaluation, analysis, interpretation; and presentation of results. This paper reveals that AI significantly enhances personalized marketing, customer engagement, operational efficiency, and strategic decision-making by analyzing large datasets and identifying patterns in customer behavior. However, challenges such as GDPR compliance, algorithmic bias, and the need for transparency are prominent. The findings indicate that businesses can gain a competitive advantage by addressing these challenges and implementing recommendations such as creating job positions like Intelligent Ethics and Intelligent Data Protection Officers. The study highlights the importance of blending AI with human intuition and creativity to make well-rounded strategic decisions. It also emphasizes the need for comprehensive training programs in collaboration with academic institutions and AI companies to address the talent gap. The potential implications include improved marketing strategies, enhanced customer engagement, and sustainable growth. Recommendations for future research focus on exploring empirical studies to evaluate the long-term impacts of AI-driven marketing and customer engagement, as well as comparative studies to benchmark the effectiveness of AI-powered promotion and client interaction in various organizational settings.",
