    "abstract": "LSM-Tree-based key-value stores such as HBase, RocksDB, and Cassandra use a fixed data block size. In this study, we show that using a fixed block size can lead to unnecessary read amplification and cache pollution. To address this issue, we propose a dynamic data block size control method to store small key-values in small data blocks and large key-values in large data blocks to minimize disk I/Os. However, using small data blocks for small key-values can result in performance issues due to increased disk seeks. To mitigate this problem, we implement a two-level cache system, which involves a lower level conventional BlockCache for storing larger, coarse-grained data blocks and an upper level cache, KVCache, for storing smaller, fine-grained key-value pairs. Our experiments show that the dynamic data block size control and fine-grained KVCache help effectively reduce read amplification and improve read performance in HBase.",
