    "abstract": "Converting natural language (NL) questions into SQL queries, referred to as Text-to-SQL, has emerged as a pivotal technology for facilitating access to relational databases, especially for users without SQL knowledge. Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has markedly propelled the field of natural language processing (NLP), opening new avenues to improve text-to-SQL systems. This study presents a systematic review of LLM-based text-to-SQL, focusing on four key aspects: (1) an analysis of the research trends in LLM-based text-to-SQL; (2) an in-depth analysis of existing LLM-based text-to-SQL techniques from diverse perspectives; (3) summarization of existing text-to-SQL datasets and evaluation metrics; and (4) discussion on potential obstacles and avenues for future exploration in this domain. This survey seeks to furnish researchers with an in-depth understanding of LLM-based text-to-SQL, sparking new innovations and advancements in this field.",
