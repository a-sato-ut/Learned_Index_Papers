    "abstract": "Deep learning, an advanced kind of artificial intelligence, has recently aided in the intelligent growth of many different sectors. Power grid regulation, one of the key areas for using artificial intelligence technology, has to take inspiration from Internet culture and fully utilize the capabilities of AI to raise the bar for business intelligence. This paper first compares the intelligent enhanced scheduling computing architecture with the traditional scheduling computing architecture, and discusses the current situation and limitations of traditional methods in the field of power system regulation. On this basis, the usual artificial intelligence application scenarios in power flow calculation adjustment, operation optimization scheduling, and power grid static security analysis are examined. Finally, the credibility of artificial intelligence is summarized, and the development of artificial intelligence in the field of power system regulation is prospected.",
