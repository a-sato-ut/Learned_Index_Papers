    "abstract": "This paper investigates the existing resource management approaches in Cloud Data Centres for energy and thermal efficiency. It identifies the need for integrated computing and cooling systems management and learning-based solutions in resource management systems. A taxonomy on energy and thermal efficient resource management in data centres is proposed based on an in-depth analysis of the literature. Furthermore, a detailed survey on existing approaches is conducted according to the taxonomy and recent advancements including machine learning-based resource management approaches and cooling management technologies are discussed.",
