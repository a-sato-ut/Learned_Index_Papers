    "abstract": "This work discusses several use cases of post-mortem mobile device tracking in which privacy is required e.g. due to client-confidentiality agreements and sensibility of data from government agencies as well as mobile telecommunication providers. We argue that our proposed Bloom filter based privacy approach is a valuable technical building block for the arising General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requirements in this area. In short, we apply a solution based on the Bloom filters data structure that allows a 3rd party to perform some privacy saving set relations on a mobile telco's access logfile or other mobile access logfile from harvesting parties without revealing any other mobile users in the proximity of a mobile base station but still allowing to track perpetrators.",
