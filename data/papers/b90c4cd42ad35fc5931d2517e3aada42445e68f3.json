    "abstract": "This paper conducts a corresponding study on the construction of a translation talent pool internally through the context of information retrieval technology. It first discusses the current state of development of information retrieval technology in various countries in the present era and the current social development of information retrieval technology. A model of the system is constructed by basing it on information retrieval technology. The system model of information retrieval technology combined with the optimisation problems associated with translation talent pools is also investigated, incorporating a factorisation algorithm. The results of the study show that the system model of big data combined with information retrieval technology has good application in concrete practical applications after modelling and performing internal upgrading.",
