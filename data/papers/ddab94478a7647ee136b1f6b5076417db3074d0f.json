    "abstract": "Machine programming is an emerging research area that improves the software development life cycle from design through deployment. We present a tutorial on machine programming research highlighting aspects relevant to the data systems community. We divide this tutorial into three parts: We begin with an introduction to machine programming introducing its three pillars: intention, invention, and adaptation. Then, we provide an overview of the data ecosystem central to all machine programming systems, highlighting challenges and novel opportunities relevant to the data systems community. Finally, we describe recent advances in machine programming research and how these directions use various data sets to improve the ease of creating and maintaining performant software systems.",
