    "abstract": "Blockchain has become increasingly popular for data management in recent years. However, the existing blockchain systems lack efficient semantic queries, particularly keyword queries. To address this issue, we propose a learned-index-based semantic keyword query architecture on blockchain. First, our architecture records data semantics information to support semantic keyword queries. Second, we establish the lookup table index for semantic information among blocks and the block-level recursive model index for blocks to improve the query efficiency. We store the lookup table in the extended block headers to maintain the result’s completeness, and we store recursive model indexes off chain to optimize the maintenance efficiency. Third, we propose a verifiable query algorithm based on our proposed architecture to maintain the result’s correctness. Finally, the experimental results show that combining the lookup table and the learned index effectively improves the query efficiency on blockchain.",
