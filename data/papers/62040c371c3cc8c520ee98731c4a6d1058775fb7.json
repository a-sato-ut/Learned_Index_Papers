    "abstract": "In the dynamic intersection of information technology and educational advancement, the implementation of big data analytics emerges as a catalyst for revolutionizing teaching and student management methodologies. This study delves into the integration of big data in education, highlighting a notable shift from mere quantitative analysis to a more nuanced understanding of qualitative learning experiences and individual student needs. We explore the development of sophisticated models for allocating teaching resources, emphasizing personalized instructional strategies, and refining student management systems to incorporate experiential insights. Our approach pivots on leveraging big data to foster an enriched, custom-tailored learning environment, aiming to heighten student engagement, satisfaction, and overall learning outcomes.",
