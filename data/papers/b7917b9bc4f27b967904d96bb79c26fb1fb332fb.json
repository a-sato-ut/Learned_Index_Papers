    "abstract": "Single-leg revenue management is a foundational problem of revenue management that has been particularly impactful in the airline and hotel industry: Given n units of a resource, e.g. flight seats, and a stream of sequentially-arriving customers segmented by fares, what is the optimal online policy for allocating the resource. Previous work focused on designing algorithms when forecasts are available, which are not robust to inaccuracies in the forecast, or online algorithms with worst-case performance guarantees, which can be too conservative in practice. In this work, we look at the single-leg revenue management problem through the lens of the algorithms-with-advice framework, which attempts to harness the increasing prediction accuracy of machine learning methods by optimally incorporating advice about the future into online algorithms. In particular, we develop online algorithms which optimally trade-off consistency (performance when advice is accurate) and competitiveness (performance when advice is inaccurate) for every advice. Our results extend to other unit-cost online allocations problems such as the display advertising and the multiple secretary problem together with more general variable-cost problems such as the online knapsack problem.",
