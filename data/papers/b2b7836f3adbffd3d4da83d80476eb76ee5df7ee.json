    "abstract": "Significance As AI systems become more capable, they may internally represent concepts outside the sphere of human knowledge. This work gives an end-to-end example of unearthing machine-unique knowledge in the domain of chess. We obtain machine-unique knowledge from an AI system (AlphaZero) by a method that finds novel yet teachable concepts and show that it can be transferred to human experts (grandmasters). In particular, the new knowledge is learned from internal mathematical representations without a priori knowing what it is or where to start. The produced knowledge from AlphaZero (new chess concepts) is then taught to four grandmasters in a setting where we can quantify their learning, showing that machine-guided discovery and teaching is possible at the highest human level.",
