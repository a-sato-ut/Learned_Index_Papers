    "abstract": "Abstract:This contribution emphasizes that reading—academic or not—is an act that takes place in front of and in relation to others, deeply situated and often provisional. I suggest a reading—or rather a redescription—of the Odyssey's Telemachus as such a reader, and of Telemachus's own scholarly readers by extension. I advocate thinking of reading as neither purely generous or suspicious, and I reflect on the status of ostensibly minor figures as observers and readers.",
