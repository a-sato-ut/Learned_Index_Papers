    "abstract": "Vector databases efficiently gather, retrieve, and evaluate data in vector form, complementing and enhancing Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications. The utilization of programming languages is typically necessitated for accessing these databases, requiring users to possess programming skills, thus hindering the user experience. Additionally, challenges are encountered due to differences in the syntax used among vector databases of different vendors, making querying and migration between diverse vector databases difficult. The main goal of the research presented in this paper is to provide users with straightforward use and uniform access to vector databases of various vendors. To achieve such a goal, a prototype of Domain-Specific Language (DSL) is developed, with the aim to overcome challenges in accessing vector databases and to offer users the benefits of simplified interaction with vector databases.",
