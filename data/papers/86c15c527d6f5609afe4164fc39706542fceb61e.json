    "abstract": ": With the improvement of the people’s living quality. More and more people start to pay attention to the food tracing, but the ideal blockchain technology, as a solution to this problem, which have a low speed of searching and will occupy a large space of the storage, is unsuitable for the actual situation. Thus, in this paper, we mainly use and improve a method named Kademlia to make it to search the data rapidly. As for the data storage, we use the Simplified Payment Verification as the storage method. For this method, it is not necessary for most of the nodes to store a large amount of the data, nodes just need to verify that if the transaction data is stored in the block. In this way, we prevent the useless cost to the memory, and increase the efficiency of the searching at the same time.",
