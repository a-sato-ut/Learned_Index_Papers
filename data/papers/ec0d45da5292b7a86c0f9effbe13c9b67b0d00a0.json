    "abstract": "Compaction is a necessary, but often costly background process in write-optimized data structures like LSM-trees that reorganizes incoming data that is sequentially appended to logs. In this paper, we introduce Transformation-Embedded LSM-trees (TE-LSM), a novel approach that transparently embeds a variety of data transformations into the compaction process. While many others have sought to reduce the high cost of compaction, TE-LSMs leverage the opportunity to embed other useful work to amortize IO costs and amplification. We illustrate the use of a TE-LSM in Mycelium, our prototype built on top of RocksDB that extends the compaction process through a cross-column-family merging mechanism. Mycelium enables seamless integration of a transformer interface and aims to better prepare data for future accesses based on access patterns. We use Mycelium to explore three types of transformations: splitting column groups, converting data formats, and index building. In addition to providing a cost model analysis, we evaluate Mycelium's write and read performance using YCSB workloads. Our results show that Mycelium incurs a 20% write throughput overhead - significantly lower than the 35% to 60% overhead observed in naive approaches that perform data transformations outside of compaction-while achieving up to 425% improvements in read latency compared to RocksDB baseline.",
