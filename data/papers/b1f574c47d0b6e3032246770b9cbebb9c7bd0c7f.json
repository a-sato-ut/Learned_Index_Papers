    "abstract": "In recent years, machine learning has transitioned from a field of academic research interest to a field capable of solving real-world business problems. However, the deployment of machine learning models in production systems can present a number of issues and concerns. This survey reviews published reports of deploying machine learning solutions in a variety of use cases, industries, and applications and extracts practical considerations corresponding to stages of the machine learning deployment workflow. By mapping found challenges to the steps of the machine learning deployment workflow, we show that practitioners face issues at each stage of the deployment process. The goal of this article is to lay out a research agenda to explore approaches addressing these challenges.",
