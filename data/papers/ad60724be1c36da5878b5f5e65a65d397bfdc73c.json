    "abstract": "Real-time spatial data analysis is a fundamental requirement for many critical applications in this digital era. However, such a requirement in practice is often hindered by the low performance of spatial join queries on conventional parallel systems. Specifically, all existing spatial join methods, including both classical plane sweeping algorithms and various grid- or tree-based index-assisted algorithms, have unacceptably long execution times and thus fail to deliver real-time performance. In this paper, we present RayJoin, a new and effective approach that utilizes the ray tracing hardware in modern GPUs (e.g., NVIDIA RT Cores) as accelerators to overcome the bottlenecks in spatial join processing and push the performance to an unprecedented level. Specifically, RayJoin consists of a high-performance and high-precision spatial join framework that accelerates two vital spatial join queries: line segment intersection (LSI) and point-in-polygon test (PIP). Besides these ray tracing-backed algorithms, RayJoin also contains new solutions to address two challenging technical issues: (1) how to meet the high precision requirement of spatial data analysis with the insufficient precision support by the underlying hardware, and (2) how to reduce the high buildup cost of the hardware-accelerated index, namely Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH), while maintaining optimal query performance. Our evaluation results show that RayJoin achieves speedups from 3.0x to 28.3x over any existing highly optimized methods in high precision. To the best of our knowledge, RayJoin stands as the sole solution capable of meeting the real-time requirements of diverse workloads, taking under 460ms to join millions of polygons.",
