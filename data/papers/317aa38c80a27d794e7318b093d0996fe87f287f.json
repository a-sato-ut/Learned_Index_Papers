    "abstract": "Image background recognition and reconstruction is an important research content in the field of computer vision. Instead of paying attention to all the targets in the image, this paper only focuses on the static background in the scene. Therefore, an adaptive semantic propagation method is proposed to reconstruct the complete background of static images. It executes single-connected region division and edge detection on a single frame. Experimental results demonstrate the robustness and adaptability of the method, achieving convincing performance under both simple and complex road conditions.",
