    "abstract": "Classification of text is an important field of research and a core task in Natural Language Processing (NLP). It spans many different domains from determining “fake” news, finding spam emails, and language detection. A common problem in software development is generating the appropriate code snippet for a task. There are communities for software development that allow people to ask questions and provide answers such as Stack Overflow. These answers in Stack Overflow represent snippets in a few lines which contain mostly API Calls from various libraries in Python. The issue that arises is that many people will provide completely different answers for a particular question in which many cases the answers are wrong. We pose the task of determining if a pair of a question/problem and a corresponding code snippet is appropriate or not as a binary classification problem. Our goal is to learn from these pairs the correct code snippets for certain problems. An example of this is the code snippet,",
