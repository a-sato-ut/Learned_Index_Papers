    "abstract": "Data world is ruling us since last decade. The rapidity at which heterogeneous data is being generated from various bases such as social networks and media, mobile devices, e-commerce applications, bank transactions etc. are contributing to the concept of data known as Big Data having various features such as volume, velocity, variety, value, veracity, variability and visualization. There exist various challenges with regard to efficient storage, processing, and management of day to day increase in heterogeneous data. Hence, comes the picture of Query processing which helps in extracting data from the database efficiently using various indexing techniques in less time. This paper discusses about Big data requirements for indexing, big data query processing and offers a comparison study on different indexing techniques such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) Indexing, Non Artificial Intelligence (NAI) Indexing and Collaborative Artificial Indexing (CAI) Indexing to help future researchers to choose suitable techniques based on their requirements.",
