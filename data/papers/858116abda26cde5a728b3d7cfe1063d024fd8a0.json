    "abstract": "The goal of this paper is to improve (upcycle) an existing large language model without the prohibitive requirements of continued pre-training of the full-model. The idea is to split the pre-training data into semantically relevant groups and train an expert on each subset. An expert takes the form of a lightweight adapter added on the top of a frozen base model. During inference, an incoming query is first routed to the most relevant expert which is then loaded onto the base model for the forward pass. Unlike typical Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, the experts in our method do not work with other experts for a single query. Hence, we dub them\"introvert\"experts. Freezing the base model and keeping the experts as lightweight adapters allows extreme parallelism during training and inference. Training of all experts can be done in parallel without any communication channels between them. Similarly, the inference can also be heavily parallelized by distributing experts on different GPUs and routing each request to the GPU containing its relevant expert. We implement a proof-of-concept version of this method and show the validity of our approach.",
