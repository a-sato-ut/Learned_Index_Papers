    "abstract": "Recently, the research of PDEs is regarded as one of the most important disciplines. Almost all scientific problems can be described by a differential equation, especially, many physical phenomena can be described by the system of coupled Wave-Klein-Gordon equations, which plays an important role in high-performance computing, control engineering, and electronic power system. Consequently, in our work, we use the PINNs to solve the numerical solution of coupled Wave-Klein-Gordon equations, to help us better understand the nonlinear physical phenomena, and to promote the rapid development of various fields such as in high-performance computing, control engineering, and electronic power system.",
