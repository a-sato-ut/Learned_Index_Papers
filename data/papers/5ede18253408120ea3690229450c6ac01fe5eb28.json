    "abstract": "LBS-RT (location-based service in a real-time manner) has become popular because it can provide quick and timely services. Range query is often used in LBS-RT, which finds objects in a specified area, and spatial indices are often used to speed up range query. However, in LBS-RT, there are some difficulties. Spatial index was originally designed to index static dataset, but the dataset is dynamic in LBS-RT, which needs lots of insert and delete operations. To meet the gap, this paper proposes a new distributed spatial index called GQ-QBS. It's a two-layer master-slave mode that consists of a global index and multiple local indices. The global index (GQ-tree) is responsible for the dynamic load balancing and auto-scaling, while the local index (QBS-tree) is for quickly updating and querying. Experiments show the index has a significant advantage in LBS-RT.",
