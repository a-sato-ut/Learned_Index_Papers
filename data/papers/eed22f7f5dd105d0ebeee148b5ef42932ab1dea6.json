    "abstract": "Industrial product inspection is often performed using Anomaly Detection (AD) frameworks trained solely on non-defective samples. Although defective samples can be collected during production, leveraging them usually requires pixel-level annotations, limiting scalability. To address this, we propose ADClick, an Interactive Image Segmentation (IIS) algorithm for industrial anomaly detection. ADClick generates pixel-wise anomaly annotations from only a few user clicks and a brief textual description, enabling precise and efficient labeling that significantly improves AD model performance (e.g., AP = 96.1\\% on MVTec AD). We further introduce ADClick-Seg, a cross-modal framework that aligns visual features and textual prompts via a prototype-based approach for anomaly detection and localization. By combining pixel-level priors with language-guided cues, ADClick-Seg achieves state-of-the-art results on the challenging ``Multi-class''AD task (AP = 80.0\\%, PRO = 97.5\\%, Pixel-AUROC = 99.1\\% on MVTec AD).",
