    "abstract": "With the continuous development of digital forensics technology, its application is becoming more and more widespread in various fields, and the use of digital forensics storage services is also increasing. However, the issue of the credibility of digital forensics data has always been a focus of attention. In this paper, we conduct in-depth research on the credibility of digital forensics data. By analyzing existing technologies and methods, we propose a credibility verification mechanism for digital forensics data based on decentralized and distributed public ledgers, aiming to improve the credibility and security of digital forensics data.",
