    "abstract": "Trajectory-based applications have acquired significant attention over the past decade with the rising size of trajectory data generated by users. However, building trajectory-based applications is still cumbersome due to the lack of unified frameworks to tackle the underlying trajectory analysis challenges. Inspired by the tremendous success of the BERT deep learning model in solving various NLP tasks, our vision is to have a BERT-like system for a myriad of trajectory analysis operations. We envision that in a few years, we will have such system, where no one needs to worry again about each specific trajectory analysis operation. Whether it is trajectory imputation, similarity, clustering, or whatever, it would be one system that researchers, developers, and practitioners can deploy to get high accuracy for their trajectory operations.",
