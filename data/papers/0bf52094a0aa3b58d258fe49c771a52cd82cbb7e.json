    "abstract": ": The increasing number of indexed documents makes manual retrieval almost impossible when they are retrieved or stored automatically. The solution to this problem consists of using information retrieval systems, which seek to present the most relevant data items to the user in order of relevance. Therefore, this work aims to conduct a theoretical survey of the most used algorithms in the Information Retrieval ﬁeld using Learning to Rank methods. We also provide an analysis regarding the datasets used as benchmarks in the literature. We observed that RankSVM and LETOR collection are the most frequent method and datasets employed in the analyzed works.",
