    "abstract": "The sustainability of the current Internet architecture is a challenging task in the view of tremendous and dramatic growth of smart mobile devices and its data traffic demand. The Named Data Networking (NDN) is one of the promising paradigms for the future Internet to deal with the existing and exploding Internet data traffic patterns. In NDN, the producer mobility allows consumer to get content from the content producer within the minimal delay. However, when the producer is in mobility, it suffers from various flaws such as Interest packet loss, Interest retransmission, long handover latency, high costs, and a non-optimal routing path. This research work examines the most common used approaches to manage producer mobility in NDN and proposed a mobility mechanism to manage producer mobility in NDN domain. For this purpose, the mobility mechanism design mobility management packets and modify the NDN forwarding plane to support the mobility packets and overcome the associated issues.",
