    "abstract": "The integration of deep learning and serious games within educational frameworks offers innovative pathways to enhance student engagement and learning outcomes. This research presents a serious game in a web application designed to improve mathematical skills among first-year secondary school students in Peru. The project employs advanced deep learning techniques to personalize learning paths based on individual performance metrics. Using a dataset of diagnostic responses, our model achieved 84.1 per cent accuracy after 50 training epochs, indicating significant potential for personalized education. The findings highlight the effectiveness of combining gamification with deep learning to transform educational practices and address learning disparities.",
