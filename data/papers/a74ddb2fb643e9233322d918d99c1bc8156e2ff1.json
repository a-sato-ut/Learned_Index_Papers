    "abstract": "As the complexity of engineered systems continues to increase, Model‐Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) methodologies, languages, and tools are increasingly insufficient to meet the demands of modern systems engineering. This paper proposes a research roadmap for the development of an AI‐driven machine, referred to as MBSE Co‐Pilot, designed to augment MBSE activities, not only to address the demand for technical advancement in MBSE, but also to better facilitate the adoption of MBSE for organizations transitioning into digital engineering. The MBSE Co‐Pilot leverages advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies, including but not limited to Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision, to support model development, model management, and model comprehension.",
