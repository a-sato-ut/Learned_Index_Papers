    "abstract": "We consider the general problem of online convex optimization with time-varying budget constraints in the presence of predictions for the next cost and constraint functions, that arises in a plethora of network resource management problems. A novel saddle-point algorithm is designed by combining a Follow-The-Regularized-Leader iteration with prediction-adaptive dynamic steps. The algorithm achieves <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathcal O(T^{(3-\\beta)/4})$ </tex-math></inline-formula> regret and <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathcal O(T^{(1+\\beta)/2})$ </tex-math></inline-formula> constraint violation bounds that are tunable via parameter <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\beta \\!\\in \\![1/2,1$ </tex-math></inline-formula>) and have constant factors that shrink with the predictions quality, achieving eventually <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathcal O(1)$ </tex-math></inline-formula> regret for perfect predictions. Our work extends the seminal FTRL framework for this new OCO setting and outperforms the respective state-of-the-art greedy-based solutions which naturally cannot benefit from predictions, without imposing conditions on the (unknown) quality of predictions, the cost functions or the geometry of constraints, beyond convexity.",
