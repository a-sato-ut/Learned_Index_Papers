    "abstract": "To optimize a music recommendation system, advanced algorithms and big data methods were used. The optimization was conducted to solve the cold-start problem and bias and improve accuracy and user satisfaction. By incorporating machine learning in the optimization, the music recommendation system has better performance. Performance reports were created to show accuracy and user satisfaction. The optimization method can be used to provide recommendations and user incentives.",
