    "abstract": "We now turn to the solving of differential equations in which the solution is a function that depends on several independent variables. One such equation is called a partial differential equation (PDE, plural: PDEs). The subject of PDEs is enormous. At the same time, it is very important, since so many phenomena in nature and technology find their mathematical formulation through such equations. Knowing how to solve at least some PDEs is therefore of great importance to engineers. In an introductory book like this, nowhere near full justice to the subject can be made. However, we still find it valuable to give the reader a glimpse of the topic by presenting a few basic and general methods that we will apply to a very common type of PDE. We shall focus on one of the most widely encountered partial differential equations: the diffusion equation, which in one dimension looks like",
