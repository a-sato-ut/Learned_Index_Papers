    "abstract": "We consider the allocation of m balls (jobs) into n bins (servers). In the standard Two-Choice process, at each step t = 1, 2, . . . ,m we first sample two randomly chosen bins, compare their two loads and then place a ball in the least loaded bin. It is well-known that for any ≥ n, this results in a gap (difference between the maximum and average load) of log2 logn + Θ(1) (with high probability).",
