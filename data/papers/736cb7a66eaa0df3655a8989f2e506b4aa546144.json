    "abstract": "This paper presents predicate transfer, a novel method that optimizes join performance by pre-filtering tables to reduce the join input sizes. Predicate transfer generalizes Bloom join, which conducts pre-filtering within a single join operation, to multi-table joins such that the filtering benefits can be significantly increased. Predicate transfer is inspired by the seminal theoretical results by Yannakakis, which uses semi-joins to pre-filter acyclic queries. Predicate transfer generalizes the theoretical results to any join graphs and use Bloom filters to replace semi-joins leading to significant speedup. Evaluation shows predicate transfer can outperform Bloom join by 3.1x on average on TPC-H benchmark.",
