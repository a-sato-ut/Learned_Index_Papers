    "abstract": "Serverless computing, or Function-as-a-Service (FaaS), offers resource efficiency and flexible pay-as-you-go pricing, making it attractive for diverse workloads. However, performance interference---especially in CPU scheduling---remains a key challenge due to shared resource contention, latency variability, and skewed function popularity. Existing schedulers often rely on proxy metrics like CPU utilization, which misalign with user-centric goals such as low latency and strict Service Level Objectives (SLOs). We propose eMFS, a performance- and interference-aware scheduler that reduces SLO violations in serverless platforms. It combines an eBPF-based latency monitor, a meta-learning model for CPU prediction, and an SLO-guided Multi-Level Feedback Queue (MLFQ) scheduler for priority-based execution. Together, these components enable dynamic, SLO-aware scheduling tailored to serverless workloads.",
