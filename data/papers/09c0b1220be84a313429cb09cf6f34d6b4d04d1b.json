    "abstract": "MySQL is a popular open relational database management system developed using organizational programming to create and manage data. E-lag is widely used in many fields such as business, finance and healthcare. While data processing focuses on optimizing data for performance, organizational programming will optimize physical storage data. This research provides an overview of MySQL and its architecture, explores the various methods and tools used to manage and organize databases, and discusses the benefits of these techniques and how they impact MySQL performance. Reactive systems, such as AutoAdmin, focus on historical workloads, while proactive systems, like QB5000 and DQM, predict future workloads for fully automated optimization.",
