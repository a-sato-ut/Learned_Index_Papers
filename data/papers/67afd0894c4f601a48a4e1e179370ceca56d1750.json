    "abstract": "We investigate the \\emph{linear contextual bandit problem} with independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) contexts. In this problem, we aim to develop a \\emph{Best-of-Both-Worlds} (BoBW) algorithm with regret upper bounds in both stochastic and adversarial regimes. We develop an algorithm based on \\emph{Follow-The-Regularized-Leader} (FTRL) with Tsallis entropy, referred to as the $\\alpha$-\\emph{Linear-Contextual (LC)-Tsallis-INF}. We show that its regret is at most $O(\\log(T))$ in the stochastic regime under the assumption that the suboptimality gap is uniformly bounded from below, and at most $O(\\sqrt{T})$ in the adversarial regime. Furthermore, our regret analysis is extended to more general regimes characterized by the \\emph{margin condition} with a parameter $\\beta \\in (1, \\infty]$, which imposes a milder assumption on the suboptimality gap. We show that the proposed algorithm achieves $O\\left(\\log(T)^{\\frac{1+\\beta}{2+\\beta}}T^{\\frac{1}{2+\\beta}}\\right)$ regret under the margin condition.",
