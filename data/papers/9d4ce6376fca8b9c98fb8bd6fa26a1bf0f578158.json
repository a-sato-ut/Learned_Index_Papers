    "abstract": "Approximate k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) is a fundamental problem in data science. A lot of traditional approaches have been devel- oped to solve this problem, yet none of them can achieve high accuracy, small memory usage and fast query speed. These methods can be in- efficient since they don’t improve with experience(learning from errors or heuristics employed). A recent trend in algorithm design consists of augmenting classic data structures with machine learning models. Mo- tivated by this, we present a learned index for kNN query in massive amounts of data, named LBF. It robustly combines a traditional index with a learned model. What’s more, a multiple feature extraction mod- ule is embedded into our model to make full use of the raw input. These make our method satisfies all the requirements of a good similarity in- dexing scheme. Theoretical proofs and experimental results on a variety of datasets show that compared to the state-of-the-art methods, we can achieve a comparable accuracy with much less memory usage.",
