    "abstract": "Set query is a fundamental problem in computer systems. Plenty of applications rely on the query results of membership, association, and multiplicity. A traditional method that addresses such a fundamental problem is derived from Bloom filter. However, such methods may fail to support element deletion, require additional filters or apriori knowledge, making them unamenable to a high-performance implementation for dynamic set representation and query. In this paper, we envision a novel sketch framework that is multi-functional, non-parametric, space efficient, and deletable. As far as we know, none of the existing designs can guarantee such features simultaneously. To this end, we present a general shifting framework to represent auxiliary information (such as multiplicity, association) with the offset. Thereafter, we specify such design philosophy for a hash table horizontally at the slot level, as well as vertically at the bucket level. Theoretical and experimental results jointly demonstrate that our design works exceptionally well with three types of set queries under small memory.",
