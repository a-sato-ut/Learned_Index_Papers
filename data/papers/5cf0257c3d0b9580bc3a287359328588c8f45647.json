    "abstract": "Machine learning and vector search are two research topics that developed in parallel in nearby communities. However, unlike many other fields related to big data, machine learning has not significantly impacted vector search. In this opinion paper we attempt to explain this oddity. Along the way, we wander over the numerous bridges between the two fields.",
