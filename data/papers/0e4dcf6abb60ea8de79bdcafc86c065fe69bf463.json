    "abstract": "Web Application Firewall (WAF) is widely deployed in cloud to protect web applications, whose performance becomes one of the major bottlenecks for web services. In this paper, we comprehensively analyze several root causes that downgrade WAF’s efficiency. Inspired by that, we build a caching system RuleCache to devise optimization strategies for improving WAF’s performance. Among, Rule Ordering Cache is online learning an optimal order of the ruleset for a better performance of blocking. Rule Result Cache reuses rule results of targets, saving large repetitive computations. Additionally, Rule Prepruning Cache aims to cut extra overhead by processing the static rules in the offline stage. Our evaluation demonstrates that the prototype can improve the performance by up to 3.85x, 1.57x, and 2.4x respectively with the above modules, and up to 5.5x in total.",
