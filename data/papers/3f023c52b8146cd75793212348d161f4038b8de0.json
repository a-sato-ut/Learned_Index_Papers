    "abstract": "The detection of malicious websites has become a critical issue in cybersecurity. Therefore, this paper offers a comprehensive review of data-driven methods for detecting malicious websites. Traditional approaches and their limitations are discussed, followed by an overview of data-driven approaches. The paper establishes the data-feature-model-extension pipeline and the latest research developments of data-driven approaches, including data preprocessing, feature extraction, model construction and technology extension. Specifically, this paper compares methods using deep learning models proposed in recent years. Furthermore, the paper follows the data-feature-model-extension pipeline to discuss the challenges together with some future directions of data-driven methods in malicious website detection.",
