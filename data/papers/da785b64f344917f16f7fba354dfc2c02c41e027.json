    "abstract": "Linking and searching the right data for operational decision support in Cyber-Physical Systems remains a challenge. Links between logically related data are difficult to establish at the time of collection. In addition, for the execution of search queries issued by data-driven services, a full collection scan must often be performed. In this paper, we design a hybrid system that allows decision support services to use a quantum search algorithm for finding the right data in sub-linear time in order to link them.",
