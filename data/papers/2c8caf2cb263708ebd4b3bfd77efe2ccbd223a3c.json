    "abstract": ": Efficient query planning is crucial in large smart databases, where the complexity of joining tables can exceed a hundred. This paper addresses the pivotal role of cardinality estimation in generating effective query plans within a Database Management System (DBMS). Over the past decade, various estimation methods have been developed, yet their accuracy tends to decrease as the number of joined tables increases due to specific constraints and prerequisites. This paper introduces EVACAR, a novel cardinality estimation method rooted in the theory of approximate aggregate calculations. Unlike existing methods, EVACAR is designed to alleviate limitations associated with increasing table joins. Our method not only matches but often surpasses the accuracy of machine learning methods, achieving superior results for 75-88% of the evaluated queries (subplans). This advancement signifies a promising step towards optimizing query performance in large-scale smart databases.",
