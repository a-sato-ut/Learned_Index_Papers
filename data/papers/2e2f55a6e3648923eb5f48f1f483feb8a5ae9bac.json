    "abstract": "Along with the fast development of network applications, network research has attracted more and more attention, where one of the most important research directions is networked multi-label classification. Based on it, unknown labels of nodes can be inferred by known labels of nodes in the neighborhood. As both the scale and complexity of networks are increasing, the problems of previously neglected system overhead are turning more and more seriously. In this article, a novel multi-objective optimization-based networked multi-label seed node selection algorithm (named as MOSS) is proposed to improve both the prediction accuracy for unknown labels of nodes from labels of seed nodes during classification and the system overhead for mining the labels of seed nodes with third parties before classification. Compared with other algorithms on several real networked data sets, MOSS algorithm not only greatly reduces the system overhead before classification but also improves the prediction accuracy during classification.",
