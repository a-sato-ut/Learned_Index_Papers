    "abstract": "To this end, this paper examines the best practice in making the finance and banking industry SQL BI more efficient and effective in terms of query execution and real-time analysis. Techniques such as Indexing, partitioning, query rewriting, parallel processing, in memory tables are explained practical to large financial data sets. These strategies were identified to enhance techniques such as transaction monitoring, customer analysis, financial reporting, and risk management since their execution duration is time-consuming. The paper will also focus on the role of the optimized SQL queries in the decision-making process and the issues, seen when seeking constant performance in financially volatile demonstrative systems.",
