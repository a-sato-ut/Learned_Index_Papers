    "abstract": "According to diagnostic criteria, a patient can find clinics he needs depending on the symptoms of disease. The paper shows an effective solution that allows rapid access to information about clinic using Redis in memory database technology. In this paper using Redis help us to collect a wide array of geospatial capabilities finding the best way and build out this type of functionality. Redis has the capability to store by Redis intelligent optimized systems in their native format, and update and serve them with minimal computing infrastructure needed to implement these algorithms at scale. Also, our approach is to study the effect of the databases on system’s working speed, comparing Redis and MS SQL.",
