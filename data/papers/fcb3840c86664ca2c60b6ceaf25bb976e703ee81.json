    "abstract": "We present Ver1, a data discovery system that identifies project-join views over large repositories of tables that do not contain join path information, and even when input queries are inaccurate. Ver implements a reference architecture to solve both the technical (scale and search) and human (semantic ambiguity, navigating a large number of results) problems of view discovery. We demonstrate users find the view they want when using Ver with a user study and we demonstrate its performance with large-scale end-to-end experiments on real-world datasets containing tens of millions of join paths.",
