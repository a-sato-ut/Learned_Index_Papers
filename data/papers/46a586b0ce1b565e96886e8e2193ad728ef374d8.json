    "abstract": "Nowadays, big data management and analytics are gaining momentum within the research community, stirred-up by both sophisticated theoretical models and pragmatic achievements mainly appearing in the target Cloud-based applications and systems. In this so-delineated context, three top-class topics have emerged in the literature: (i) advanced big data management and analytics in distributed environments; (ii) privacy-preserving big data management and analytics in distributed environments; (iii) approximate big-data-management-and-analytics techniques and algorithms over uncertain and imprecise big data repositories in distributed environments. These critical topics are now heavily influencing the research community, and will play more and more a first-class role in actual and future research experiences. Following this clear evidence, in this paper we provide the current state-of-the-art on the reference topics, along with considerations for driving future research efforts in the field.",
