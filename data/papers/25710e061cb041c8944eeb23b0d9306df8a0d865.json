    "abstract": "The exponential growth of digital data challenges traditional learning approaches. As data storage requirements surpass the zettabyte scale, conventional methods for learning, classifying, and recognizing patterns based on handcrafted feature extractors become less effective and unsustainable for massive datasets. Deep learning is rapidly evolving and playing an increasingly important role in our lives. It is making significant progress in traditional domains such as disease diagnosis, predictive forecasting, and recommendation systems, while also gaining grip in natural language processing, feature extraction, and visualization. Deep learning overcomes the limitations of shallow networks, enabling better abstraction of hierarchical representations for high-dimensional, large-scale training data and more efficient training. This paper reviews the development of deep learning applications compared to traditional learning methods. The authors analyze optimization techniques to improve training accuracy and reduce duration. They contribute to the field by examining the evolution of deep learning outcomes, including benefits, challenges, and limitations.",
