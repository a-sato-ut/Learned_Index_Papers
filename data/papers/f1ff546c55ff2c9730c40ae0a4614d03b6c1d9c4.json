    "abstract": "This course will cover the compact volume data structure and various tools available in the open-source library OpenVDB. Since its release in 2012 it has become an industry standard and has been used in numerous VFX movies release in the past decade. It is also adopted by most commercial software packages used by the movie industry, including Houdini, RenderMan, Arnold, RealFlow, Clarisse, Guerrilla Render, Maxwell Render, Modo, V-Ray, Octane Render, 3Delight, Embergee, Blender, Chaos Phoenix, Corona, FumeFX, KeyShot, LightWave, ThinkingParticles, Eddy, Bifrost, Siemens NX, Unreal Engine, as well as bindings for Mathmatica. Recently, OpenVDB has also found use in new fields, including SLAM, autonomous driving, industrial design, 3D printing, medical imaging, rocket design, arial surveillance, robotics, and many machine learning applications. Finally, OpenVDB was the first open-source project to be adopted by the Academy Software Foundation (ASWF) and the Linux Foundation (in 2018).",
