    "abstract": "Cache plays an important role in storage systems. With better allocation of cache space to each storage device, total I/O latency can be reduced remarkably. To achieve this goal, we propose an Accurate Probabilistic miss ratio curve approximation for Adaptive Cache allocation (APAC) system. APAC can obtain near-optimal performance for allocating cache space with low overhead. Specifically, with a linear-time probabilistic approximation of reuse distance of all blocks inside each device, APAC can accurately estimate the miss ratio curve (MRC). Furthermore, APAC utilizes the MRCs to obtain the near-optimal configuration of cache allocation by dynamic programming. Experimental results show that APAC achieves higher accuracy in MRC approximation compared to the state-of-the-art methods, leading to higher hit ratio and lower latency of the block storage systems.",
