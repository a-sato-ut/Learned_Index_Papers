    "abstract": "DC/DC boost converters have become ubiquitous in recent years as the use of renewable energy resources has increased. This is due to the simplicity with which they can be implemented. However, it is vital to employ regulatory techniques to stabilize the voltage term of DC/DC boost converters by increasing their robustness and fast response to system dynamics. This paper tends to present a newly developed optimal controller to achieve trajectory tracking for regulating the output of a DC/DC boost converter using the twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) reinforcement-learning algorithm. In the proposed control scheme, the Proportional-Integral (PI) controller’s feedback is considered the adjustable controller coefficients, which will be adaptively designed by the twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) algorithm. Simulation outcomes have confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed control.",
