    "abstract": "In this paper, we focus on the problem of item matching using only the description. Those specific item not only lack of a unique code but also contain short text description, making the item matching processes difficult. Our goal is comparing products using only the description provided by the purchase process. Therefore, evaluating other characteristics differences can uncover possible flaws during the acquiring phase. However, the text of the items that we were working on was very small, with numbers due to the nature of the products and we have a limited amount of time to develop the solution which was 8 weeks. As result, we showed that working using a well-oriented methodology we were able to deliver a successful MVP and achieve the results expected with up to 55% match.",
