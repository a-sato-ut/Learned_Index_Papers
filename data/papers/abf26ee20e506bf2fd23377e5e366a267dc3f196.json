    "abstract": "Because of the increasing increase of data, which is frequently referred to as \"big data,\" many different businesses have been severely impacted in recent years, necessitating the implementation of sophisticated data management and analytics solutions. By virtue of the fact that it provides scalable resources for applications that are data-intensive, cloud computing has emerged as an indispensable platform for the management of these enormous databases. The evolving landscape of distributed systems in cloud settings is the primary emphasis of this study, which is situated within the framework of big data analytics and data management. With the purpose of providing a comprehensive overview of distributed systems that are used in cloud settings for data-intensive computing, the review article seeks to offer. Furthermore, it evaluates the many ideas, techniques, and technical improvements that have been established in order to properly manage, store, and analyse large amounts of data. A comprehensive literature evaluation of recently published scientific references was successfully completed by our team. The analysis takes into account the theoretical foundations, as well as the research that has already been conducted on distributed computing systems, cloud-based data management, and enormous data analytics. The study places an emphasis on the significant role that distributed computing plays in ensuring the success of big data analytics. The interplay between distributed systems and cloud computing paradigms has resulted in the development of solutions that are robust, scalable, and economical for activities that need a significant amount of data. It is still a huge problem to ensure that data security, privacy, and interoperability are maintained across the many cloud services.",
