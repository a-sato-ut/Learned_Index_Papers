    "abstract": "In order to overcome the challenges of inadequate classification accuracy in existing fake cybersecurity threat intelligence mining methods and the lack of high-quality public datasets for training classification models, we propose a novel approach that significantly advances the field. We improved the attention mechanism and designed a generative adversarial network based on the improved attention mechanism to generate fake cybersecurity threat intelligence. Additionally, we refine text tokenization techniques and design a detection model to detect fake cybersecurity threats intelligence. Using our STIX-CTIs dataset, our method achieves a remarkable accuracy of 96.1%, outperforming current text classification models. Through the utilization of our generated fake cybersecurity threat intelligence, we successfully mimic data poisoning attacks within open-source communities. When paired with our detection model, this research not only improves detection accuracy but also provides a powerful tool for enhancing the security and integrity of open-source ecosystems.",
