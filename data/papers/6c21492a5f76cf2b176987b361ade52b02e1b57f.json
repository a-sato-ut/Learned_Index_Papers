    "abstract": "The underwater Internet of Things (UIoT) is becoming a significant means to explore marine areas, and compared to IoT, UIoT is deployed in a three-dimension marine space characterized by water depth. In this article, we propose a reliable data forwarding framework for UIoT, and aim to leverage the named data networking to reduce delays and costs of underwater data forwarding. The main idea behind this framework is to integrate the push-based data forwarding mode with the pull-based mode to realize in-networking caching and aggregation. That is, the push-based mode implements in-networking caching to shorten distances between users and marine data while the pull-based mode exploits aggregation to share data among users from the closest provider through one data forwarding process. The experimental results show that the framework achieves the above objectives.",
