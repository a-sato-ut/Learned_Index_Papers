    "abstract": "Sequence alignment algorithms based on Burrows-Wheeler Transform are among mainstream algorithms for mapping short reads, produced by second generation sequencing technology, to reference sequences. These algorithms are efficiently implemented in software like BWA-ALN and BWA-MEM, which are widely used in various application related to genome sequence analysis. Experiments show that the resource usage and running time of such implementations are strongly related to some parameters. In this work, we firstly propose a unified memory usage model for both BWA-ALN and BWA-MEM to help picking parameters not exceeding the hardware memory limit. We then proposed two running time models for BWA-ALN to to help choosing best parameter values and determining if multi-thread should be used as the number of reads vary. The effectiveness of these models are demonstrated through intensive experiments.",
