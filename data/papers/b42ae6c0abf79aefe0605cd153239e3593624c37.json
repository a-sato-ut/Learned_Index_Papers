    "abstract": "Named Data Networking (NDN) is a recent promising future Internet architecture, which forwards packets based on the named data. To realize this paradigm, a quick enough index with high capacity for forwarding processes has to be utilized in NDN forwarding plane. Unfortunately, all indexes proposed are based on the traditional data structures, which have to make a trade-off between the memory consumption and the lookup speed. In view of this, a neural network-based index, called Learning Tree, is proposed in NDN forwarding plane. Preliminary evaluations indicate that Learning Tree can minimize the memory consumption to 20% compared with traditional hash table and has a practicable high name lookup speed.",
