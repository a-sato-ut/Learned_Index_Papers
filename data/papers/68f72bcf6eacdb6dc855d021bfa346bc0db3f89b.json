    "abstract": "The rapid and unforeseen rise of artificial intelligence (AI) raises numerous questions regarding its applicability across various fields. Consequently, it is essential to consider its impact on education. This study primarily examines the utilisation of AI within the context of the flipped classroom teaching model, with a particular focus on the audio components of educational video materials. For instance, AI can facilitate replacing a speaker's voice with that of another individual or translating it into a different language while nearly maintaining the original speaker's voice. The application of Retrieval-Based Voice Conversion (RVC) models can significantly aid this process.",
