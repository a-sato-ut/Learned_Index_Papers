    "abstract": "Traffic accident prediction and detection are critical for enhancing road safety, and vision-based traffic accident anticipation (Vision-TAA) has emerged as a promising approach in the era of deep learning. This paper reviews 147 recent studies, focusing on the application of supervised, unsupervised, and hybrid deep learning models for accident prediction, alongside the use of real-world and synthetic datasets. Current methodologies are categorized into four key approaches: image and video feature-based prediction, spatio-temporal feature-based prediction, scene understanding, and multi modal data fusion. While these methods demonstrate significant potential, challenges such as data scarcity, limited generalization to complex scenarios, and real-time performance constraints remain prevalent. This review highlights opportunities for future research, including the integration of multi modal data fusion, self-supervised learning, and Transformer-based architectures to enhance prediction accuracy and scalability. By synthesizing existing advancements and identifying critical gaps, this paper provides a foundational reference for developing robust and adaptive Vision-TAA systems, contributing to road safety and traffic management.",
