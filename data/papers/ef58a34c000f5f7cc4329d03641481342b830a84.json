    "abstract": "Several manufacturers have already started to commercialize near-bank Processing-In-Memory (PIM) architectures. Near-bank PIM architectures place simple cores close to DRAM banks and can yield significant performance and energy improvements in parallel applications by alleviating data access costs. Real PIM systems can provide high levels of parallelism, large aggregate memory bandwidth and low memory access latency, thereby being a good fit to accelerate the widely-used, memory-bound Sparse Matrix Vector Multiplication (SpMV) kernel. This paper provides the first comprehensive analysis of SpMV on a real-world PIM architecture, and presents SparseP, the first SpMV library for real PIM architectures. We make three key contributions. First, we implement a wide variety of software strategies on SpMV for a multithreaded PIM core and characterize the computational limits of a single multithreaded PIM core. Second, we design various load balancing schemes across multiple PIM cores, and two types of data partitioning techniques to execute SpMV on thousands of PIM cores: (1) 1D-partitioned kernels to perform the complete SpMV computation only using PIM cores, and (2) 2D-partitioned kernels to strive a balance between computation and data transfer costs to PIM-enabled memory. Third, we compare SpMV execution on a real-world PIM system with 2528 PIM cores to state-of-the-art CPU and GPU systems to study the performance and energy efficiency of various devices. SparseP software package provides 25 SpMV kernels for real PIM systems supporting the four most widely used compressed matrix formats, and a wide range of data types. Our extensive evaluation provides new insights and recommendations for software designers and hardware architects to efficiently accelerate SpMV on real PIM systems.",
