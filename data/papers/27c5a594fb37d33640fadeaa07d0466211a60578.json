    "abstract": "Hyperparameter tuning is an essential task in automatic machine learning and big data management. \nTo accelerate tuning, many recent studies focus on augmenting BO, the primary hyperparameter tuning strategy, by transferring information from other tuning tasks.\nHowever, existing studies ignore program similarities in their transfer mechanism, thus they are sub-optimal in cross-program transfer when tuning tasks involve different programs. \nThis paper proposes CaTHPO, a code-aware cross-program transfer hyperparameter optimization framework, which makes three improvements. \n(1) It learns code-aware program representation in a self-supervised manner to give an off-the-shelf estimate of program similarities. \n(2) It adjusts the surrogate and AF in BO based on program similarities, thus the hyperparameter search is guided by accumulated information across similar programs. \n(3) It presents a safe controller to dynamically prune undesirable sample points based on tuning experiences of similar programs. \nExtensive experiments on tuning various recommendation models and Spark applications have demonstrated that CatHPO can steadily obtain better and more robust hyperparameter performances within fewer samples than state-of-the-art competitors.",
