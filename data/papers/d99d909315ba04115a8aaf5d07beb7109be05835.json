    "abstract": "With the emergence of voice assistants and large language models, conversational interaction with information has become part of everyday life. The eighth edition of the search-oriented conversational AI (SCAI) workshop brings together practitioners and researchers from various disciplines to discuss challenges and advances in conversational search systems. This year’s edition focuses on evaluations beyond relevance and accuracy and looks at conversational search from the user’s perspective. The workshop features a shared task on user-centered evaluation datasets and metrics, challenging participants to develop new and innovative ways to evaluate conversational search systems while accounting for the needs and preferences of users.",
