    "abstract": "In the week of November 10--15, 2019, 44 researchers from the fields of information retrieval and Web search, natural language processing, human computer interaction, and dialogue systems met for the Dagstuhl Seminar 19461 \"Conversational Search\" to share the latest development in the area of conversational search and discuss its research agenda and future directions. The clear signal from the seminar is that research opportunities to advance conversational search are available to many areas and that collaboration in an interdisciplinary community is essential to achieve the goals. This report overviews the program and selected findings of the working groups.",
