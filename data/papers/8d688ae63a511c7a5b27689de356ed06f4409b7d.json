    "abstract": "Simple Summary In this study, we analyzed gene expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and splicing quantitative trait loci (sQTL) in the loin muscle of pigs. Utilizing genomic and transcriptomic data from 582 muscle samples, we identified thousands of loci associated with gene expression and splicing, many of which were previously unreported. Our results highlight distinct genomic architectures and regulatory mechanisms underlying eQTLs and sQTLs. Through colocalization analysis, we pinpointed the PHKG1 (Phosphorylase Kinase Catalytic Subunit Gamma 1) gene as a strong candidate for influencing meat quality traits due to its role in glycogen metabolism. This work provides a valuable resource for deciphering genetic regulation in pig muscle and advancing strategies to improve meat quality traits.",
