    "abstract": "Learned optimizers (LOs) can significantly reduce the wall-clock training time of neural networks, substantially reducing training costs. However, they can struggle to optimize unseen tasks (meta-generalize), especially when training networks wider than those seen during meta-training. To address this, we derive the Maximal Update Parametrization ($\\mu$P) for two state-of-the-art learned optimizer architectures and propose a simple meta-training recipe for $\\mu$-parameterized LOs ($\\mu$LOs). Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that LOs meta-trained with our recipe substantially improve meta-generalization to wider unseen tasks when compared to LOs trained under standard parametrization (SP), as they are trained in existing work. We also empirically observe that $\\mu$LOs trained with our recipe exhibit unexpectedly improved meta-generalization to deeper networks ($5\\times$ meta-training) and surprising generalization to much longer training horizons ($25\\times$ meta-training) when compared to SP LOs.",
