    "abstract": "The Hopfield Neural Network (HNN) is a significant neural network which is applied in diverse applications such as signal reconstruction, image analysis, and optimization. In this paper, we propose a novel method for analyzing or determining the stability of generalized continuous feedback neural networks, which abandons the traditional approach of constructing Lyapunov energy function. The paper also provides relevant proofs for this method. By mathematical proof, it is concluded that the continuous Hopfield network is globally asymptotically stable, and this result is consistent with the result obtained by constructing the energy function.",
