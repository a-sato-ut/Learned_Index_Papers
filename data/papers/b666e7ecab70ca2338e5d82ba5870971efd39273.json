    "abstract": "On March 13, 2024, Ethereum implemented EIP-4844, designed to enhance its role as a data availability layer. While this upgrade reduces data posting costs for rollups, it also raises concerns about its impact on the consensus layer due to increased propagation sizes. Moreover, the broader effects on the overall Ethereum ecosystem remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we conduct an empirical analysis of the impact of EIP-4844 on consensus security, Ethereum usage, rollup transaction dynamics, and the blob gas fee mechanism. We explore changes in synchronization times, provide quantitative assessments of rollup and user behaviors, and deepen the understanding of the blob gas fee mechanism, highlighting both enhancements and areas of concern post-upgrade.",
