    "abstract": "We study learning-based sketching for Hessians, which is known to provide considerable speedups to second order optimization. A number of works have shown how to sketch or subsample the Hessian to speed up each iteration, but such sketches are usually specific to the matrix at hand, rather than being learned from a distribution. We extend such schemes to learned sketches, where we learn different potentially different sketches for the different iterations, and show empirically that learned sketches, compared with their \"non-learned\" counterparts, improve the approximation accuracy for a large number of important problems, including LASSO, SVM, and matrix estimation with nuclear norm constraints.",
