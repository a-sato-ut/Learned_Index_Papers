    "abstract": "A global name mapping system is required for ICN-IP coexistence. This poster presents a global name mapping system to provide general name mapping services while ensuring query performance and scalability. With efficient general name mapping and dynamic update mechanisms, the system can serve as a common infrastructure in ICN-IP coexistence architecture. We implement the name mapping system, and the preliminary evaluation results show that it outperforms legacy DNS for query performance and is scalable. Compared to BIND 9, the QPS of the system is improved by 130%, and the response time is reduced by more than 60%.",
