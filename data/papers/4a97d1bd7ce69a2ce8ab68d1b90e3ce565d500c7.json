    "abstract": "Transwarp ArgoDB is a one-stop distributed flash database newly issued by Transwarp. It can replace the Hadoop + MPP hybrid architecture, satisfying business’s various demands for big data platform. Therefore, businesses can use big data platform more efficiently and make better use of big data’s commercial value. It supports standard SQL syntax and provides advanced technical capabilities such as multi-mode analysis, realtime data processing, storage and calculation decoupling, mixed load, data federation, mixed deployment of heterogeneous servers and so on. Through an ArgoDB database, we can meet the needs of data warehouse, real-time data warehouse, data mart and federal computing. While reducing platform complexity and it total cost of ownership, it improves business response speed. As an excellent database product, it has successfully replaced Oracle, DB2, Teradata and other foreign products in all walks of life.",
