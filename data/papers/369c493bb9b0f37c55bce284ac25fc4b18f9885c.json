    "abstract": "Program synthesis is an active research field in academia, national labs, and industry. Yet, work directly applicable to scientific computing, while having some impressive successes, has been limited. This report reviews the relevant areas of program synthesis work for scientific computing, discusses successes to date, and outlines opportunities for future work. This report is the result of the Workshop on Program Synthesis for Scientific Computing was held virtually on August 4-5 2020 (https://prog-synth-science.github.io/2020/).",
