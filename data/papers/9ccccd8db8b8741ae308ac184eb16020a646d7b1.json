    "abstract": "In this work, we extend the convex body chasing problem to an adversarial setting, where an agent (the Player) is tasked to chase a sequence of convex bodies generated adversarially by an opponent. The Player aims to minimize the cost associated with its total movements, while the Opponent tries to maximize. The set of feasible convex bodies is finite and known to both agents, which allows us to provide performance guarantees with max-min optimality rather than via the competitive ratio. Under some mild assumptions, we show the continuity of the optimal value function and provide an algorithm to numerically generate the optimal policies with performance guarantees. Finally, the theoretical results are verified through numerical examples.",
