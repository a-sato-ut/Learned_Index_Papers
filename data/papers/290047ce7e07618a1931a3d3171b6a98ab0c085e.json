    "abstract": "We propose a conceptual framework, named \"AI Security Continuum,\" consisting of dimensions to deal with challenges of the breadth of the AI security risk sustainably and systematically under the emerging context of the computing continuum as well as continuous engineering. The dimensions identified are the continuum in the AI computing environment, the continuum in technical activities for AI, the continuum in layers in the overall architecture, including AI, the level of AI automation, and the level of AI security measures. We also prospect an engineering foundation that can efficiently and effectively raise each dimension.",
