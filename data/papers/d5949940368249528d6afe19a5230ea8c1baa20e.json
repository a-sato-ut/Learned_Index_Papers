    "abstract": "Existing 3D reconstruction algorithms face challenges in real-time performance and robustness in complex environments, limiting their applicability in engineering. This paper proposes a tightly coupled fusion method for lidar-visual inertial measurement unit tailored to indoor settings. The method extracts and integrates geometric features from visual odometry and employs a spatial hashing-based incremental voxel structure to deeply fuse lidar point clouds with visual features. This approach optimizes computational efficiency while enabling real-time state estimation and robust mapping in environments with varying lighting and texture. Experiments on public and self-collected datasets demonstrate that the method achieves accurate pose estimation and 3D reconstruction, ensuring reliable performance in complex environments.",
