    "abstract": "Complex video queries can be answered by decomposing them into modular subtasks. However, existing video data management systems assume the existence of predefined modules for each subtask. We introduce VOCAL-UDF, a novel self-enhancing system that supports compositional queries over videos without the need for predefined modules. VOCAL-UDF automatically identifies and constructs missing modules and encapsulates them as user-defined functions (UDFs), thus expanding its querying capabilities. To achieve this, we formulate a unified UDF model that leverages large language models (LLMs) to aid in new UDF generation. VOCAL UDF handles a wide range of concepts by supporting both program-based UDFs (i.e., Python functions generated by LLMs) and distilled-model UDFs (lightweight vision models distilled from strong pretrained models). To resolve the inherent ambiguity in user intent, VOCAL-UDF generates multiple candidate UDFs and uses active learning to efficiently select the best one. With the self-enhancing capability, VOCAL-UDF significantly improves query performance across three video datasets.",
