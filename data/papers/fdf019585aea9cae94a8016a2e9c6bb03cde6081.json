    "abstract": "The course on programming methodology is integral to computer science and software engineering education. Knowledge graph has been an interesting topic in recent decades, and knowledge graph has propelled its use in systematically organizing, thoroughly analyzing, and fully leveraging knowledge to become a focal point in teaching research and application, yielding significant progress. Therefore, this paper proposes a method for constructing a knowledge graph tailored to the curriculum. Furthermore, it establishes a comprehensive course knowledge graph, a student capability knowledge graph, and a course resource knowledge graph. Upon this foundation, by leveraging the multi-model database ArangoDB and the visualization framework GraphVIS, a visualized system for a curriculum knowledge graph has been realized. This study aims to offer a reference for the construction and pedagogical approaches of the course, and preliminary applications of the system have received positive feedback.",
