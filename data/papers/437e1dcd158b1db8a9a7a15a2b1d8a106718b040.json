    "abstract": "The classic three-terminal electronic transistors and the emerging two-terminal ion-based memristors are complementary to each other in various nonconventional information processing systems in a heterogeneous integration approach, such as DRAM/storage-class memory hierarchy, hybrid CMOS/memristive neuromorphic crossbar arrays, and so on. Recent attempts to introduce transitive functions into memristors have given rise to gate-tunable memristive functions, hetero-plasticity and mixed-plasticity functions. However, it remains elusive under what application scenarios and in what ways transistors can benefit from the incorporation of ion-based memristive effects. Here, we introduce a new type of transistor named ‘mempolar transistor’ to the transistor family that has included the well-known unipolar and ambipolar transistors. As its name suggests, mempolar transistor has polarity with memory, reminiscent of memristor having resistance with memory. Specifically, its polarity can be converted reversibly",
