    "abstract": "The design of interconnection networks is a fundamental aspect of high-performance computing (HPC) systems. Among the available topologies, the Galaxyfly network stands out as a low-diameter and flexible-radix network for HPC applications. Given the paramount importance of collective communication in HPC performance, in this paper, we present two different all-to-all broadcast algorithms for the Galaxyfly network, which adhere to the supernode-first rule and the router-first rule, respectively. Our performance evaluation validates their effectiveness and shows that the first algorithm has a higher degree of utilization of network channels, and that the second algorithm can significantly reduce the average time for routers to collect packets from the supernode.",
