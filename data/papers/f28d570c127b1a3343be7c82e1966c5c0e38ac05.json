    "abstract": "Credit risk ratings consist of assessing the \ncreditworthiness of the issuer and gauge the risks associated with buying its \ndebt. Any delay in updating the credit risk ratings could have a severe impact \non the financial system such as the financial crisis in 2008. This paper \ndiscusses a case that leverages emerging technology and breakthrough cognitive \nanalytics in the financial industry. It specifically describes the design and \nimplementation of a predictive modeling case based on the Machine Learning \nApproach and its application in credit risk forecasting and portfolio \nmanagement. Using big data and Machine Learning, it is possible to improve \ncredit risk analysis and forecasting by allowing the algorithms to search for \npatterns using large sets of data.",
