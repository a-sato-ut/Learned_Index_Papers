    "abstract": "The data in the database with correlation is frequently separated into distinct data tables, making it difficult to query the target variable data of interest to users while also locating the correlated variable data. The throughput coefficient is used to propose a correlation analysis of database data in this research. The data of selected variables is first pre-processed, after which each variable is assessed using the pass-through coefficient and the corresponding variable association table is created in the database; finally, the method's practicality is tested by putting it into action on a web page. This research presents a novel approach to increasing the efficiency of database queries.",
