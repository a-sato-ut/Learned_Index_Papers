    "abstract": "Requirement gathering is the technique used by analysts to determine the software demands of users. The process of obtaining requirements is rarely effective, and many software projects have failed because the requirements from consumers were not fully or accurately understood. Most people agree that obtaining requirements is a crucial step in the development process. The chapter is going to analyze the reasons why inadequate requirement collecting causes numerous technology failures. Obtaining requirements is a difficult process. Defects are more prevalent when requirements are solicited. The article aims to examine these difficulties and offer a solution for the many obstacles that come with meeting the demands of the regulatory framework. The absence of stakeholders, ambiguous needs, irregular fluctuations in demand, and insufficient expertise among analysts pose difficulties for experts when it comes to gathering requirements. Preferential system surveys were shown to be one of the most effective methods for acquiring information in a range of situations and domains",
