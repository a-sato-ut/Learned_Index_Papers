    "abstract": "Despite its success in many areas, deep learning is a poor fit for use in hardware predictors because these models are impractically large and slow, but this paper shows how we can use deep learning to help design a new cache replacement policy. We first show that for cache replacement, a powerful LSTM learning model can in an offline setting provide better accuracy than current hardware predictors. We then perform analysis to interpret this LSTM model, deriving a key insight that allows us to design a simple online model that matches the offline model's accuracy with orders of magnitude lower cost. The result is the Glider cache replacement policy, which we evaluate on a set of 33 memory-intensive programs from the SPEC 2006, SPEC 2017, and GAP (graph-processing) benchmark suites. In a single-core setting, Glider outperforms top finishers from the 2nd Cache Replacement Championship, reducing the miss rate over LRU by 8.9%, compared to reductions of 7.1% for Hawkeye, 6.5% for MPPPB, and 7.5% for SHiP++. On a four-core system, Glider improves IPC over LRU by 14.7%, compared with improvements of 13.6% (Hawkeye), 13.2% (MPPPB), and 11.4% (SHiP++).",
