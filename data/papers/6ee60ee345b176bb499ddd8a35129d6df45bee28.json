    "abstract": "Abstract:In some classical scholarship of the last few decades, Ovid’s depiction of Orpheus introducing pederasty to Thrace in book 10 of the Metamorphoses has been described as “bisexual.” In this article, I ask how the subtle equation between pederasty and bisexuality may do more harm than good to LGBTQ+ classics students and scholars—particularly bi men. After providing an overview of the history of pathologizing bisexuality and homosexuality, as well as early applications of bisexual orientation to the ancient world, I turn to translations and interpretations of Met. 10.1–85 to explore how scholars have avoided, erased, euphemized and used bisexual stereotypes to explain Orpheus’s attraction to boys. I conclude with some thoughts on how to read this passage in a manner that recognizes how Ovid uses pederasty and young boys as bodies to think with, as well as how readers might combat bi-negativity in their treatment of Ovid’s text.",
