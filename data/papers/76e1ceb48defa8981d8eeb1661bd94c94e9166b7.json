    "abstract": "The DEBS Grand Challenge (GC) is a programming competition integrated into the annual ACM International Conference on Distributed and Event-Based Systems (DEBS) since DEBS 2011. The DEBS GC 2024 edition focuses on analyzing real-world telemetry data about over 200k hard drives in data centers. The goal of the challenge is to continuously compute clusters of similar drives as new data is received. This kind of analysis may be relevant to quickly identify groups of drives with a high probability of failure and enact predictive maintenance strategies. The submitted solutions are evaluated based on their design, performance, efficiency, ease of reuse, fault-tolerance, and adaptation to different problems. This paper describes the domain of telemetry data for hard drives, the data set used in the challenge, the specific problem formulation, and Challenger platform used to evaluate the submissions.",
