    "abstract": "In the current era of big spatial data, the vast amount of produced mobility data (by sensors, GPS-equipped devices, surveillance networks, radars, etc.) poses new challenges related to mobility analytics. A cornerstone facilitator for performing mobility analytics at scale is the availability of big data processing frameworks and techniques tailored for spatial and spatio-temporal data. Motivated by this pressing need, in this paper, we provide a survey of big data processing frameworks for mobility analytics. Particular focus is put on the underlying techniques; indexing, partitioning, query processing are essential for enabling efficient and scalable data management. In this way, this report serves as a useful guide of state-of-the-art methods and modern techniques for scalable mobility data management and analytics.",
