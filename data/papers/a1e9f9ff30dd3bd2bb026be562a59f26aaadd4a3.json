    "abstract": "Effective customer acquisition is crucial for digital platforms, with sequential targeting ensuring that marketing messages are both timely and relevant. The proposed deep recurrent Q-network with attention (DRQN-attention) model enhances this process by optimizing long-term rewards and increasing decision-making transparency. Tested with a data set from a digital bank, the DRQN-attention model has proven to enhance clarity in decision making and outperform traditional methods in boosting long-term rewards. Its attention mechanism acts as a strategic tool for forward planning, pinpointing crucial ad marketing channels that are likely to engage and convert prospects. This capability enables marketers to understand the dynamic targeting strategies of the proposed model that align with customer profiles, dynamic behaviors, and the seasonality of the markets, thereby boosting confidence and effectiveness in their customer acquisition strategies.",
