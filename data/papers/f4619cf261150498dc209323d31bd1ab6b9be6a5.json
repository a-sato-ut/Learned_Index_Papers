    "abstract": "The problem of sorting with priced information was introduced by [Charikar, Fagin, Guruswami, Kleinberg, Raghavan, Sahai (CFGKRS), STOC 2000]. In this setting, different comparisons have different (potentially infinite) costs. The goal is to find a sorting algorithm with small competitive ratio, defined as the (worst-case) ratio of the algorithm's cost to the cost of the cheapest proof of the sorted order. The simple case of bichromatic sorting posed by [CFGKRS] remains open: We are given two sets $A$ and $B$ of total size $N$, and the cost of an $A-A$ comparison or a $B-B$ comparison is higher than an $A-B$ comparison. The goal is to sort $A \\cup B$. An $\\Omega(\\log N)$ lower bound on competitive ratio follows from unit-cost sorting. Note that this is a generalization of the famous nuts and bolts problem, where $A-A$ and $B-B$ comparisons have infinite cost, and elements of $A$ and $B$ are guaranteed to alternate in the final sorted order. In this paper we give a randomized algorithm InversionSort with an almost-optimal w.h.p. competitive ratio of $O(\\log^{3} N)$. This is the first algorithm for bichromatic sorting with a $o(N)$ competitive ratio.",
