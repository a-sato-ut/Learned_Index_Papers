    "abstract": "We consider a variant of the classic Ski Rental online algorithm with applications to machine learning. In our variant, we allow the skier access to a black-box machine-learning algorithm that provides an estimate of the probability that there will be at most a threshold number of ski-days. We derive a class of optimal randomized algorithms to determine the strategy that minimizes the worst-case expected competitive ratio for the skier given a prediction from the machine learning algorithm,and analyze the performance and robustness of these algorithms.",
