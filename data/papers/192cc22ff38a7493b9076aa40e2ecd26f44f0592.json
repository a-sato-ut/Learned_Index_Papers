    "abstract": "Pathological program behavior may cause a non-uniform access distribution in set associative caches, leading to an increase in conflict misses. To address this challenge, prior works profile the program patterns and propose different index functions to avoid these conflict misses [11, 18]. However, as we analyze the prior work on set-associative cache indexing, we identify two major issues. First, there is no single index function that is guaranteed to perform well for every application. Second, advanced indexing schemes typically have sophisticated implementation and prohibitively long computation latency. In this paper, we propose Duelhash, a dynamic N-way indexing framework for set associative caches, which provides an effective dueling mechanism for multiple index functions at runtime with a simple and efficient hardware implementation. At runtime, the performance of the index functions are evaluated periodically, and the best performer is applied to the cache. To evaluate the performance of Duelhash, we conduct a case study on a 16-way set-associative LLC using a diverse set of benchmarks, including SPEC 2006, SPEC 2017, PARSEC 3.0, CVP and GAP. Our empirical results show that without prefetching, Duelhash provides an IPC speed up of 2.8% (with the highest being 23%) over the conventional power-of-two modulo (Default) index, compared to a 1.6% speed up of a commercialized indexing scheme (Xorhash). When pattern-based prefetchers are turned on in the L1 data and L2 caches, Duelhash can provide up to 5.8% single-core speedup over Default. Duelhash also provides a 6.2% MPKI reduction over Default for non-uniform applications, the highest among all schemes tested in the study. The reduced LLC miss rate results in an uncore energy saving of 4.9% (without prefetching) or 4.1% (with prefetching). Compared to the state-of-the-art cache indexing scheme, Duelhash offers a comparable performance in most applications while using 93% less power.",
