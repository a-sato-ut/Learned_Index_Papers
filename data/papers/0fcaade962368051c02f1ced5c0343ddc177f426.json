    "abstract": "The accelerating global spread of infectious diseases under urbanization highlights critical gaps in conventional epidemic forecasting. While traditional models struggle with complex spatiotemporal dynamics - especially in high-density, mobile regions like Beijing's Haidian District - our proposed ST-LLM4Epi framework (SpatioTemporal Large Language Model for Epidemiology) demonstrates how Large Language Models can transform prediction capabilities. Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), this study explores their potential in epidemic prediction by integrating spatial and temporal data. ST-LLM4Epi's ability to infer adjacency information and generalize from sparse datasets enhances robustness compared to conventional methods. The research aims to improve early warning systems and support public health decision-making, ultimately strengthening preparedness for future outbreaks.",
