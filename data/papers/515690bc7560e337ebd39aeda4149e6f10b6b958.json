    "abstract": "Streaming codes are packet-level codes designed to ensure the timely recovery of lost packets. This paper focuses on streaming codes for multi-hop relay networks that guarantee the recovery of message packets within a delay of $\\tau$ time slots, even when a burst erasure affecting at most $b$ packets occurs on each link. We first present a straightforward upper bound on the rate of burst-erasure-correcting streaming codes for multi-hop relay networks. The main contribution of this paper is a coding scheme that achieves rates arbitrarily close to this rate upper bound as the message size increases.",
