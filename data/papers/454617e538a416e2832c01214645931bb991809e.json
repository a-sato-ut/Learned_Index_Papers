    "abstract": "Data science has advanced significantly in recent years and allows scientists to harness large-scale data analysis techniques using open source coding frameworks. Data science is a tool that should be taught to science and engineering students in addition to their chosen domain knowledge. An applied data science minor allows students to understand data and data handling as well as statistics and model development. This move will improve reproducibility and openness of research as well as allow for greater interdisciplinarity and more analyses focusing on critical scientific challenges.",
