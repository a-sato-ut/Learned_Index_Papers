    "abstract": "Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) approach transcends the current technological innovations and automation concepts of addressing a variety of business organization problems and concerns. Microservices are an integral part of contemporary service-oriented architectures for distributed computing applications. Mining of big data with intelligence is very important for accurate predictive analysis and making critical business decisions. Big data with SOA or Service-oriented Business Intelligence (SoBI) enables business organizations to produce reliable and agile business solutions. This paper aims at presenting a brief analysis of integrating intelligence in service oriented architecture with microservices and its applications in big data organizations . The research area is based on artificial intelligence techniques like deep learning, machine learning, neural network etc. that will en-graft intelligence in mining of big data in service oriented architecture software systems.",
