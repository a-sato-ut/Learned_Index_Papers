    "abstract": "As ecommerce continues growing, huge investments in ML and NLP for Information Retrieval are following. While the vector space model dominated retrieval modelling in product search - even as vectorization itself greatly changed with the advent of deep learning -, our position paper argues in a contrarian fashion that program synthesis provides significant advantages for many queries and a significant number of players in the market. We detail the industry significance of the proposed approach, sketch implementation details, and address common objections drawing from our experience building a similar system at Tooso.",
