    "abstract": "Persistent Memory (PM) represents a very promising, next-generation memory solution with a significant impact on database architectures. Several data structures for this new technology have already been proposed. However, primarily only complete structures are presented and evaluated. Thus, the implications of the individual ideas and PM features are concealed. Therefore, in this paper, we disassemble the structures presented so far, identify their underlying design primitives, and assign them to appropriate design goals. As a result of our comprehensive experiments on real PM hardware, we can reveal the trade-offs of the primitives for various access patterns and pinpoint their best use cases.",
