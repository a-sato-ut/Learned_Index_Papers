    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved impressive results in graph classification tasks, but they struggle to generalize effectively when faced with out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Several approaches have been proposed to address this problem. Among them, one solution is to diversify training distributions in vanilla classification by modifying the data environment, yet accessing the environment information is complex. Besides, another promising approach involves rationalization, extracting invariant rationales for predictions. However, extracting rationales is difficult due to limited learning signals, resulting in less accurate rationales and diminished predictions. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a Cooperative Classification and Rationalization (C2R) method, consisting of theclassification and therationalization module. Specifically, we first assume that multiple environments are available in theclassification module. Then, we introduce diverse training distributions using an environment-conditional generative network, enabling robust graph representations. Meanwhile, therationalization module employs a separator to identify relevant rationale subgraphs while the remaining non-rationale subgraphs are de-correlated with labels. Next, we align graph representations from theclassification module with rationale subgraph representations using the knowledge distillation methods, enhancing the learning signal for rationales. Finally, we infer multiple environments by gathering non-rationale representations and incorporate them into theclassification module for cooperative learning. Extensive experimental results on both benchmarks and synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of C2R. Code is available at https://github.com/yuelinan/Codes-of-C2R.",
