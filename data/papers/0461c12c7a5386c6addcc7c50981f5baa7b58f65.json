    "abstract": "We propose a neural particle level set (Neural PLS) method to accommodate tracking and evolving dynamic neural representations. At the heart of our approach is a set of oriented particles serving dual roles of interface trackers and sampling seeders. These dynamic particles are used to evolve the interface and construct neural representations on a multi-resolution grid-hash structure to hybridize coarse sparse distance fields and multi-scale feature encoding. Based on these parallel implementations and neural-network-friendly architectures, our neural particle level set method combines the computational merits on both ends of the traditional particle level sets and the modern implicit neural representations, in terms of feature representation and dynamic tracking. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by showcasing its performance surpassing traditional level-set methods in both benchmark tests and physical simulations.",
