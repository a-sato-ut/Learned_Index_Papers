    "abstract": ": The importance of data structures makes the people to use them in many domains in real world to facilitate the dealing with the data and information. Dealing with these data structures in real worlds are possible using different operations such as insertion, deletion, searching, sorting. The effectiveness of these operations with data structures is important and can be measured in different ways. In this paper we focus on evaluate the effectiveness of operations specially searching and sorting operations on three data structure that is array, singly linked list and tree and measured based on a high range of numbers to increase the accuracy by calculate the elapsed time to execute operations and the number of comparisons and swapping in operation.",
