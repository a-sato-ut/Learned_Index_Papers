    "abstract": "Software engineering researchers and practitioners have pursued manners to reduce the amount of time and effort required to develop code and increase productivity since the emergence of the discipline. Generative language models are just another step in this journey, but it will probably not be the last one. In this chapter, we propose DAnTE, a Degree of Automation Taxonomy for software Engineering, describing several levels of automation based on the idiosyncrasies of the field. Based on the taxonomy, we evaluated several tools used in the past and in the present for software engineering practices. Then, we give particular attention to AI-based tools, including generative language models, discussing how they are located within the proposed taxonomy, and reasoning about possible limitations they currently have. Based on this analysis, we discuss what novel tools could emerge in the middle and long term.",
