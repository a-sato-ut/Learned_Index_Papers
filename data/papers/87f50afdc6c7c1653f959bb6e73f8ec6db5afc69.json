    "abstract": "In a group of images, the recurrent foreground objects are considered as the key objects in the group of images. In co ‐ saliency detection, these are described as common saliency objects. The aim is to be able to naturally guide the user's gaze to these common salient objects. By guiding the user's gaze, users can easily find these common saliency objects without interference from other information. Therefore, a method is proposed for reducing user visual attention based on co ‐ saliency detection. Through the co ‐ saliency detection algorithm and matting algorithm for image preprocessing, the exact position of non ‐ common saliency objects (called Region of Interest here, i",
