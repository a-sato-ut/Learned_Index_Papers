    "abstract": "\n There have been many decades of work on optimizing query processing in database management systems. Recently, modern machine learning (ML), and specifically reinforcement learning (RL), has gained increased attention as a means to develop a query optimizer (QO). In this work, we take a closer look at two recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) RL-based QO methods to better understand their behavior. We find that these RL-based methods do not generalize as well as it seems at first glance. Thus, we ask a simple question:\n How do SOTA RL-based QOs compare to a simple, modern, adaptive query processing approach?\n To answer this question, we choose two simple adaptive query processing techniques and implemented them in PostgreSQL. The first adapts an individual join operation on-the-fly and switches between a Nested Loop Join algorithm and a Hash Join algorithm to avoid sub-optimal join algorithm decisions. The second is a technique called\n Lookahead Information Passing\n (LIP), in which adaptive semijoin techniques are used to make a pipeline of join operations execute efficiently. To our surprise, we find that this simple adaptive query processing approach is not only competitive to the SOTA RL-based approaches but, in some cases, outperforms the RL-based approaches. The adaptive approach is also appealing because it does not require an expensive training step, and it is fully interpretable compared to the RL-based QO approaches. Further, the adaptive method works across complex query constructs that RL-based QO methods currently cannot optimize.\n",
