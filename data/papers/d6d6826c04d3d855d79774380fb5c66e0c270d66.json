    "abstract": "gapless is a new tool for combined execution of correction, scaffolding and gap filling using PacBio or Oxford Nanopore reads. Continuity, correctness, and completeness of genome assemblies are important for many biological projects. Long reads represent a major driver towards delivering high-quality genomes, but not everybody can achieve the necessary coverage for good long read-only assemblies. Therefore, improving existing assemblies with low-coverage long reads is a promising alternative. The improvements include correction, scaffolding, and gap filling. However, most tools perform only one of these tasks and the useful information of reads that supported the scaffolding is lost when running separate programs successively. Therefore, we propose a new tool for combined execution of all three tasks using PacBio or Oxford Nanopore reads. gapless is available at: https://github.com/schmeing/gapless.",
