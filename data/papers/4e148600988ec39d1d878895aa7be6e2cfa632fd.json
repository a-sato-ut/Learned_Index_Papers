    "abstract": "Data discovery refers to a set of tasks that enable users and downstream applications to explore and gain insights from massive collections of data sources such as data lakes. In this tutorial, we will provide a comprehensive overview of the most recent table discovery techniques developed by the data management community. We will cover table understanding tasks such as domain discovery, table annotation, and table representation learning which help data lake systems capture semantics of tables. We will also cover techniques enabling various query-driven discovery and table exploration tasks, as well as how table discovery can support key data science applications such as machine learning and knowledge base construction. Finally, we will discuss future research directions on developing new table discovery paradigms by combining structured knowledge and dense table representations, as well as improving the efficiency of discovery using state-of-the-art indexing techniques, and more.",
