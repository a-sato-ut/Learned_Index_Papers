    "abstract": "Interpreting and describing mobile applications' privacy behaviors to ensure creating consistent and accurate privacy notices is a challenging task for developers. Traditional approaches to creating privacy notices are based on predefined templates or questionnaires and do not rely on any traceable behaviors in code which may result in inconsistent and inaccurate notices. In this paper, we present an automated approach to detect privacy behaviors in code of Android applications. We develop Privacy Action Taxonomy (PAcT), which includes labels for Practice (i.e. how applications use personal information) and Purpose (i.e. why). We annotate ~5,200 code segments based on the labels and create a multi-label multi-class dataset with ~14,000 labels. We develop and train deep learning models to classify code segments. We achieve the highest F-1 scores across all label types of 79.62% and 79.02% for Practice and Purpose.",
