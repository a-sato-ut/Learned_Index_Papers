    "abstract": "The quantization-based approaches are the effective techniques for addressing the problem of approximate nearest neighbor search. However, most of these methods typically employ a fixed number of nProbes as the termination condition for each query. This practice can lead to unnecessary query processing time because many queries can be terminated early, before completing the greedy search in the nearest nProbes subspace. To address this issue, we propose an early termination method to speed up the search processing of quantization-based methods. At the heart of our proposal is to exploit an effective probabilistic feature generated by locality sensitive hashing to learn a uniformed prediction model, allowing the termination condition for each query to be predicted adaptively. Experimental results over various real-world high dimensional datasets show that our proposal outperforms competitors in both query accuracy and efficiency, achieving an average running time reduction of up to around 7x.",
