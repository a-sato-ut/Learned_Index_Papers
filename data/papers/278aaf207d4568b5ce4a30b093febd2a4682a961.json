    "abstract": "In the Distance Oracle problem, the goal is to preprocess $n$ vectors $x_1, x_2, \\cdots, x_n$ in a $d$-dimensional metric space $(\\mathbb{X}^d, \\| \\cdot \\|_l)$ into a cheap data structure, so that given a query vector $q \\in \\mathbb{X}^d$ and a subset $S\\subseteq [n]$ of the input data points, all distances $\\| q - x_i \\|_l$ for $x_i\\in S$ can be quickly approximated (faster than the trivial $\\sim d|S|$ query time). This primitive is a basic subroutine in machine learning, data mining and similarity search applications. In the case of $\\ell_p$ norms, the problem is well understood, and optimal data structures are known for most values of $p$. Our main contribution is a fast $(1+\\varepsilon)$ distance oracle for any symmetric norm $\\|\\cdot\\|_l$. This class includes $\\ell_p$ norms and Orlicz norms as special cases, as well as other norms used in practice, e.g. top-$k$ norms, max-mixture and sum-mixture of $\\ell_p$ norms, small-support norms and the box-norm. We propose a novel data structure with $\\tilde{O}(n (d + \\mathrm{mmc}(l)^2 ) )$ preprocessing time and space, and $t_q = \\tilde{O}(d + |S| \\cdot \\mathrm{mmc}(l)^2)$ query time, for computing distances to a subset $S$ of data points, where $\\mathrm{mmc}(l)$ is a complexity-measure (concentration modulus) of the symmetric norm. When $l = \\ell_{p}$ , this runtime matches the aforementioned state-of-art oracles.",
