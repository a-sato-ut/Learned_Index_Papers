    "abstract": "Navigating the intricacies of data management in the era of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents both challenges and opportunities for database and data management communities. In this tutorial, we offer a comprehensive exploration into the vital role of data management across the development and deployment phases of advanced LLMs. We provide an in-depth survey of existing techniques of managing knowledge and parameter data during the whole LLM lifecycle, emphasizing the balance between efficiency and effectiveness. This tutorial stands to offer participants valuable insights into the best practices and contemporary challenges in data management for LLMs, equipping them with the knowledge to navigate and contribute to this rapidly evolving field.",
