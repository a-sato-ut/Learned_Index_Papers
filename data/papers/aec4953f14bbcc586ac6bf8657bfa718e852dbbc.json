    "abstract": "Data Structure is a fundamental course in the Computer Science Department that students need to master in order to support their algorithmic and programming skills. Data structure plays a crucial role in database implementation, file compression, shortest or fastest path finding, decision-making, and queuing systems. Despite the importance of learning data structures, students still encounter challenges while studying them. Students who fail the Data Structure course are at risk of struggling with creating efficient programs. This research aims to develop a data structure learning application by applying the reverse engineering method, which can generate source code based on simulations created by users. The application development method used is the Waterfall Method, with stages including Requirement Analysis, System Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, and Maintenance. The conclusion of this research is that the application aids users' understanding in learning data structures through the reverse engineering method.",
