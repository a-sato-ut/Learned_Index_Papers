    "abstract": "With the advent of GPUs and application-specific accelerators in embedded platforms, data-intensive applications have exacerbated the memory performance and energy bottleneck. Memory requirements and usage patterns vary widely in emerging architectures, and resource contention manifests differently based on the instance of the architecture. Workload-specific and system-specific optimizations for energy-efficient architectures are impractical due to the fast-evolving landscape of computer applications and hardware. We discuss how to apply self-awareness principles to design an energy-efficient memory subsystem, and the different degrees of self-awareness such a system can achieve. We apply these principles on approximate memory systems and observe energy savings of 10.5% for on-chip L1 cache. We believe this is a rich area for research and outline some future opportunities for using self-awareness in emerging energy-efficient architectures.",
