    "abstract": "Computational problems ranging from artificial intelligence to physics require efficient computations of large tensor expressions. These tensor expressions can often be represented in Einstein notation. To evaluate tensor expressions in Einstein notation, that is, for the actual Einstein summation, usually external libraries are used. Surprisingly, Einstein summation operations on tensors fit well with fundamental SQL constructs. We show that by applying only four mapping rules and a simple decomposition scheme using common table expressions, large tensor expressions in Einstein notation can be translated to portable and efficient SQL code. The ability to execute large Einstein summation queries opens up new possibilities to process data within SQL. We demonstrate the power of Einstein summation queries on four use cases, namely querying triplestore data, solving Boolean satisfiability problems, performing inference in graphical models, and simulating quantum circuits. The performance of Einstein summation queries, however, depends on the query engine implemented in the database system. Therefore, supporting efficient Einstein summation computations in database systems presents new research challenges for the design and implementation of query engines.",
