    "abstract": "This paper analyzes a large number of logo images from the LLD-logo dataset, by recent deep learning-based techniques, to understand not only design trends of logo images and but also the correlation to their owner company. Especially, we focus on three correlations between logo images and their text areas, between the text areas and the number of followers on Twitter, and between the logo images and the number of followers. Various findings include the weak positive correlation between the text area ratio and the number of followers of the company. In addition, deep regression and deep ranking methods can catch correlations between the logo images and the number of followers.",
