    "abstract": "Analytics database workloads often contain queries that are executed repeatedly. Existing optimization techniques generally prioritize keeping optimization cost low, normally well below the time it takes to execute a single instance of a query. If a given query is going to be executed thousands of times, could it be worth investing significantly more optimization time? In contrast to traditional online query optimizers, we propose an offline query optimizer that searches a wide variety of plans and incorporates query execution as a primitive. Our offline query optimizer combines variational auto-encoders with Bayesian optimization to find optimized plans for a given query. We compare our technique to the optimal plans possible with PostgreSQL and recent RL-based systems over several datasets, and show that our technique finds faster query plans.",
