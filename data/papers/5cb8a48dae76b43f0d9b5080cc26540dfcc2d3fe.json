    "abstract": "The context of this paper is the creation of large uniform archaeological datasets from heterogeneous published resources, such as find catalogues - with the help of AI and Big Data. The paper is concerned with the challenge of consistent assemblages of archaeological data. We cannot simply combine existing records, as they differ in terms of quality and recording standards. Thus, records have to be recreated from published archaeological illustrations. This is only a viable path with the help of automation. The contribution of this paper is a new workflow for collecting data from archaeological find catalogues available as legacy resources, such as archaeological drawings and photographs in large unsorted PDF files; the workflow relies on custom software (AutArch) supporting image processing, object detection, and interactive means of validating and adjusting automatically retrieved data. We integrate artificial intelligence (AI) in terms of neural networks for object detection and classification into the workflow, thereby speeding up, automating, and standardising data collection. Objects commonly found in archaeological catalogues - such as graves, skeletons, ceramics, ornaments, stone tools and maps - are detected. Those objects are spatially related and analysed to extract real-life attributes, such as the size and orientation of graves based on the north arrow and the scale. We also automate recording of geometric whole-outlines through contour detection, as an alternative to landmark-based geometric morphometrics. Detected objects, contours, and other automatically retrieved data can be manually validated and adjusted. We use third millennium BC Europe (encompassing cultures such as 'Corded Ware' and 'Bell Beaker', and their burial practices) as a 'testing ground' and for evaluation purposes; this includes a user study for the workflow and the AutArch software.",
