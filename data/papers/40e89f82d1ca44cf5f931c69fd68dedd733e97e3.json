    "abstract": "\n Prefetching is a crucial technique employed in traditional databases to enhance interactivity, particularly in the context of\n data exploration.\n Data exploration is a query processing paradigm in which users search for insights buried in the data, often not knowing what exactly they are looking for. Data exploratory tools deal with multiple challenges such as the need for interactivity with no a priori knowledge being present to help with the system tuning. The state-of-the-art prefetchers are specifically designed for navigational workloads only, where the number of possible actions is limited. The prefetchers that work with SQL-based workloads, on the other hand, mainly rely on data logical addresses rather than the data semantics. They fail to predict complex access patterns in cases where the database size is substantial, resulting in an extensive address space, or when there is frequent co-accessing of data. In this paper, we propose SeLeP, a semantic prefetcher that makes prefetching decisions for both types of workloads, based on the encoding of the data values contained inside the accessed blocks. Following the popular path of using machine learning approaches to automatically learn the hidden patterns, we formulate the prefetching task as a time-series forecasting problem and use an encoder-decoder LSTM architecture to learn the data access pattern. Our extensive experiments, across real-life exploratory workloads, demonstrate that SeLeP improves the hit ratio up to 40% and reduces I/O time up to 45% compared to the state-of-the-art, attaining 96% hit ratio and 84% I/O reduction on average.\n",
