    "abstract": "This work presents the first demonstration of an embedded 0.5-Flash-0.5-RRAM (0.5F0.5R) hybrid memory on Ge, which can be efficiently integrated with advanced Ge logic devices. We explore yttrium (Y)-doped GeOx (YGO) with a range of Y-doping concentrations in GeOx and achieve stable multibit Flash and high mobility logic devices for embedded nonvolatile memories technology by exploiting the superior interface properties of low YGO and the charge-trapping behaviors of high YGO. The Flash and logic devices exhibit the peak electron mobility of 1168 cm2/Vs (equivalent oxide thickness (EOT) = 18 nm) and 684 cm2/Vs (EOT = 0.8 nm), respectively. By combining a Ge-based resistive memory, the 0.5F0.5R hybrid memory can provide more than 7 b/cell by distributing bits across different physical elements. Furthermore, the negligible disturbance between the two different memories in the 0.5F0.5R structure offers a promising solution for high-density nonvolatile memory applications.",
