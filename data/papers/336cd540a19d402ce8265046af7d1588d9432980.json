    "abstract": "DRAM-NVM-based hybrid memory opens up a varied range of power-performance-area operational configurations through page migration between the high-performance DRAM and the reliable NVM. The amalgamation of two technologies requires various modifications for the existing monolithic DRAM-based systems. This paper summarizes the current research work in the areas of data placement and page migration in hybrid memories. The challenges and design solutions from a range of NVMs-PCM, STT-RAM, ReRAM is presented. This paper also identifies several research challenges in these areas.",
