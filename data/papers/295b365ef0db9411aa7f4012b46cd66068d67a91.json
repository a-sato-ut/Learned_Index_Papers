    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The study explores TikTok promotional clips’ visual and narrative depictions of Taquile Island, a rural tourism destination. Topic modeling and picture clustering uncovering dominating themes and visual patterns in AI-supported video analytics, analyzing 51 videos yielded 1301 frames and keywords. Topic modeling of retrieved keywords and image clustering showed video clips focused on Taquile’s scenic beauty, cultural traditions, and community life, supporting rural tourism promotion literature, providing insights for more authentic destination marketing campaigns, and presenting detailed grasps of destiny promotion. Still, it admits data scope and computing resource constraints and suggests further research to improve AI-driven tourism marketing analysis.",
