    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Mobile IoT, a pioneering IoT facet, enhances data acquisition. Mutual authentication ensures device validity in mobile IoT. Unlinkable authentication needs for mobile IoT data nodes during device validation. Current methods have issues: Certificate Authority (CA) faces computational load, and blockchain deals with storage and throughput. In this paper, BUA, a blockchain-based unlinkable authentication scheme, applies vector commitment for CA reduction and blockchain data compression. A binary tree auxiliary index, minimizes redundancy in vector commitment verification. This scheme fulfills security goals and boosts performance by 13.24%, surpassing similar proposols.",
