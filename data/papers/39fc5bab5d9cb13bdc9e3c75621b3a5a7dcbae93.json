    "abstract": "Deep Neural Network (DNN) inference serving presents significant challenges due to variable workloads, heterogeneous models, and strict Service Level Objectives (SLOs). While GPU acceleration enables high-throughput inference, the cost-effectiveness of these specialized resources depends on maintaining high utilization. Current DNN serving systems employ static or heuristic-based batching strategies that cannot adapt effectively to dynamic cloud workloads. We present DNN-Adapt, a novel system that employs reinforcement learning (RL) to dynamically optimize batching decisions in DNN serving environments. DNN-Adapt introduces a hybrid batching framework that combines traditional batching techniques with RL-based decision making, a multi-timescale architecture that operates at different levels of granularity, and a hybrid decision system that integrates rule-based safety constraints with learned policies.",
