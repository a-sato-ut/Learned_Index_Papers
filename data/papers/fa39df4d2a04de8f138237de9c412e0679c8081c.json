    "abstract": "Using deep neural networks to solve PDEs has attracted a lot of attentions recently. However, why the deep learning method works is falling far behind its empirical success. In this paper, we provide a rigorous numerical analysis on deep Ritz method (DRM) \\cite{Weinan2017The} for second order elliptic equations with Drichilet, Neumann and Robin boundary condition, respectively. We establish the first nonasymptotic convergence rate in $H^1$ norm for DRM using deep networks with smooth activation functions including logistic and hyperbolic tangent functions. Our results show how to set the hyper-parameter of depth and width to achieve the desired convergence rate in terms of number of training samples.",
