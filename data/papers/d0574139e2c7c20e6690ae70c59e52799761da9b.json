    "abstract": "The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is used to sense and deliver vital signs for healthcare monitoring, so rapid medical information retrieval is crucial. The information-centric model can help shorten delays of IoMT-based medical data delivery, but IoMT nodes cannot perform the information-centric model due to their limited resources. In this paper, we integrate IoMT with fog clouds and propose a fog-assisted information-centric IoMT framework so that fog nodes can help perform the information-centric model and reduce latency of IoMT-based medical information retrieval. In the framework, consumers can exploit reverse-paths and request aggregation to acquire medical information of multiple subjects from the nearest provider via one information delivery procedure. Moreover, the framework addresses the consumer mobility issue to guarantee receipt of medical information. Finally, this framework is evaluated to verify its advantages.",
