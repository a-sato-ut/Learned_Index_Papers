    "abstract": "The increasing complexity of wireless networks, driven by diverse use cases and the evolution toward 6G, demands advanced resource optimization techniques for efficient and reliable communication. Traditional methods often struggle with adaptability and scalability in such dynamic environments. This article explores large language models (LLMs) as a potential approach to wireless resource optimization. Trained on massive datasets and capable of human-like reasoning, LLMs offer unique advantages in handling complex, multi-faceted problems. We propose a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based framework that combines LLMs with domain-specific knowledge extracted from wireless standards documents, research articles, network-specific data, and other documents. This integration enhances the accuracy and reliability of LLM-driven decisions, enabling effective solutions to real-world challenges. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our RAG-based approach through a case study on spectrum management, showcasing its potential to outperform traditional methods and adapt to evolving network conditions. Lastly, we conclude with a discussion on the challenges and future directions in this promising area.",
