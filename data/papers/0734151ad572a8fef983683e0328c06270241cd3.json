    "abstract": "Prediction queries that apply machine learning (ML) models to perform analysis on data stored in the database are prevalent with the advance of research. Current database systems introduce Python UDFs to express prediction queries and call ML frameworks for inference. However, the impedance mismatch between database engines and prediction query execution imposes a challenge for query performance. First, the database engine is oblivious to the internal semantics of prediction functions and evaluates the UDF holistically, which incurs the repetitive inference context setup. Second, the invocation of prediction functions in the database does not consider that batching inference with a desirable inference batch size achieves a high performance in ML frameworks. To mitigate the mismatch, we propose to employ a prediction-aware operator in database engines, which leverages inference context reuse cache to achieve an automatic one-off inference context setup and batch-aware function invocation to ensure desirable batching inference. We implement a prototype system, called IMBridge, based on an open-source database OceanBase. Our experiments show that IMBridge achieves a 71.4x speedup on average over OceanBase for prediction query execution and significantly outperforms other solutions.",
