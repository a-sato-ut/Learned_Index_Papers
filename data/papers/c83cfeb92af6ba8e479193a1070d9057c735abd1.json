    "abstract": "Increasing multiple behavior recommendation models have achieved great successes. However, many models do not consider commonalities and differences between behaviors and data sparsity of the target behavior. This article proposes a novel multi-behavior recommendation model based on contrastive clustering learning (MBRCC). Specifically, the graph convolutional network (GCN) is employed to obtain the embeddings of users and items, respectively. Then, three kinds of tasks (including behavior-level embedding, instance-level embedding, and cluster-level embedding) are designed to optimize the embeddings of users and items. In behavior-level embedding, we design an adaptive parameter learning strategy to analyze the impact of auxiliary behaviors on the target behavior. Then, the embeddings of users for each behavior are weighted to obtain the final embeddings of users. In instance-level embedding, we employ contrastive learning to analyze the instances of user and item for mitigating the issue of data sparsity. In cluster-level embedding, we design a new cluster contrastive learning method to capture the similarity between groups of user and item. Finally, we combine these three tasks to improve the quality of the embeddings of users and items. We conduct extensive experiments on three real-world datasets and experimental results indicate that the MBRCC remarkably outperforms numerous existing recommendation models.",
