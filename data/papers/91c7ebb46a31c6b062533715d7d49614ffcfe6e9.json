    "abstract": "This paper presents AutoSteer, a learning-based solution that automatically drives query optimization in any SQL database that exposes tunable optimizer knobs. AutoSteer builds on the Bandit optimizer (Bao) and extends it with new capabilities (e.g., automated hint-set discovery) to minimize integration effort and facilitate usability in both monolithic and disaggregated SQL systems. We successfully applied AutoSteer on PostgreSQL, PrestoDB, Spark-SQL, MySQL, and DuckDB - five popular open-source database engines with diverse query optimizers. We then conducted a detailed experimental evaluation with public benchmarks (JOB, Stackoverflow, TPC-DS) and a production workload from Meta's PrestoDB deployments. Our evaluation shows that AutoSteer can not only outperform these engines' native query optimizers (e.g., up to 40% improvements for PrestoDB) but can also match the performance of Bao-for-PostgreSQL with reduced human supervision and increased adaptivity, as it replaces Bao's static, expert-picked hint-sets with those that are automatically discovered. We also provide an open-source implementation of AutoSteer together with a visual tool for interactive use by query optimization experts.",
