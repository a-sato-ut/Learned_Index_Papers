    "abstract": "Recent advances in AI techniques, as well as enabling hardware and infrastructure, has led to the integration of AI in wide-ranging domains and tasks. In particular, AI has been used to handle various types of data (including numerical, textual and image data) and has been adopted in large-scale distributed systems. From a data management perspective, this calls for the harnessing of state-of-the-art AI solutions for data management tasks and systems. aiDM is a full-day workshop that offers a stage for innovative interdisciplinary research that studies the interaction between AI and data management and develops new AI technologies for data-related tasks. This year, aiDM'23 particularly focuses on the transparent exploitation of AI techniques in existing enterprise-level data management workloads.",
