    "abstract": "Variational quantum algorithms show potential in effectively operating on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. A variational approach to reinforcement learning has been recently proposed, incorporating linear-optical interferometers and a classical learning model known as projective simulation (PS). PS is a decision-making tool for reinforcement learning and can be classically represented as a random walk on a graph that describes the agent's memory. In its optical quantum version, this approach utilizes quantum walks of single photons on a mesh of tunable beamsplitters and phase shifters to select actions. In this work, we present the implementation of this algorithm on Ascella, a single-photon-based quantum computer from Quandela. The focus is drawn on solving a test bed task to showcase the potential of the quantum agent with respect to the classical agent.\n \n \n \n \n Published by the American Physical Society\n 2024\n \n \n",
