    "abstract": "We consider the problem of private approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search. A user seeks the closest vector to a target query <tex>$q$</tex> among <tex>$M$</tex> vectors stored in a system of <tex>$N$</tex> non-colluding databases. The user aims to retrieve the ANN without revealing information about <tex>$q$</tex> to any of the <tex>$N$</tex> databases. We provide an information-theoretic formulation of the problem and propose a scheme based on a tree-structured ANN search mechanism. The proposed scheme uses a coding-theoretic approach to traverse the branch in the tree structure that leads to the approximately closest vector to <tex>$q$</tex> while guaran-teeing perfect information-theoretic privacy. We prove that our approach achieves a communication cost of <tex>$O(N^{2}M^{\\frac{1}{N-1})}$</tex> for <tex>$N$</tex> databases. For large <tex>$M$</tex>, this communication cost is lower than competing cryptographic ANN search protocols.",
