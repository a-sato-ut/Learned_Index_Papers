    "abstract": "Artificially-intelligent agents are in development to support NASA crewmembers during exploration missions where earth-based medical support is unfeasible. We describe the need for such agents, provide a functional overview, and present a concept of operations demonstrating how they could support crew health. We list desirable characteristics to support crew medical officers. We suggest that this technology can also be applied in remote terrestrial environments where expert consultation is inaccessible.",
