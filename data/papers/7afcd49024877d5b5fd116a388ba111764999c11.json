    "abstract": "Databases are the foundation of application services. Low-quality SQL queries leads to performance bottlenecks of the database, which in turn may affect other services. The research focuses on developing a comprehensive framework that enables self-awareness, self-optimization, self-evaluation for databases basing on anomaly detection and experience. Algorithms are used to automatically detect anomalies of the database resources. Slow SQL statements are extracted from logs for trend analysis and large models are used in analyzing changes in SQL execution plans to find out the SQLs to be optimized. Finally, an Experiential rule library is decided for SQL Optimization. The research is able to find out poor-performing SQL queries and provide optimization recommendations, which helps to improve working efficiency and ensure the stability of database services.",
