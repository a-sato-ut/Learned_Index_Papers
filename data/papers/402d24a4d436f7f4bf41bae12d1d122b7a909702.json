    "abstract": "We propose a new building block, IdleBlock, which naturally prunes connections within the block. To fully utilize the IdleBlock we break the tradition of monotonic design in state-of-the-art networks, and introducing hybrid composition with IdleBlock. We study hybrid composition on MobileNet v3 and EfficientNet-B0, two of the most efficient networks. Without any neural architecture search, the deeper \"MobileNet v3\" with hybrid composition design surpasses possibly all state-of-the-art image recognition network designed by human experts or neural architecture search algorithms. Similarly, the hybridized EfficientNet-B0 networks are more efficient than previous state-of-the-art networks with similar computation budgets. These results suggest a new simpler and more efficient direction for network design and neural architecture search.",
