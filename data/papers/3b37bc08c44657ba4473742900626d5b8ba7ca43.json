    "abstract": "Augmenting algorithms with learned predictions is a promising approach for going beyond worst-case bounds. Dinitz, Im, Lavastida, Moseley, and Vassilvitskii~(2021) have demonstrated that a warm start with learned dual solutions can improve the time complexity of the Hungarian method for weighted perfect bipartite matching. We extend and improve their framework in a principled manner via \\textit{discrete convex analysis} (DCA), a discrete analog of convex analysis. We show the usefulness of our DCA-based framework by applying it to weighted perfect bipartite matching, weighted matroid intersection, and discrete energy minimization for computer vision. Our DCA-based framework yields time complexity bounds that depend on the $\\ell_\\infty$-distance from a predicted solution to an optimal solution, which has two advantages relative to the previous $\\ell_1$-distance-dependent bounds: time complexity bounds are smaller, and learning of predictions is more sample efficient. We also discuss whether to learn primal or dual solutions from the DCA perspective.",
