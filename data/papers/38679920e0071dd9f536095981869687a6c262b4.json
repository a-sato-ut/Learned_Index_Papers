    "abstract": "In recent years, with the acceleration of the process of economic globalization and the deepening of China’s financial liberalization, the scale of international short-term capital flows has been extremely rapid. This article mainly studies the deep learning digital economy scale measurement method and its application based on the big data cloud platform. This article uses the indirect method to estimate the stock of renminbi circulating abroad. The results show that the application of big data cloud platforms can increase the development share of digital media and digital transactions in the digital economy and optimize the structure of China’s digital economy.",
