Visual query interfaces (VQIs) are popular lowand industry (for example, PubChema) are increasingly exposing VQIs to enable an end user to draw a subgraph search query interactively without writing a single line of code in a proprietary QL. We focus on two novel streams of research that exploit the central role played by no-code visual environments in subgraph search. First, classical VQI frameworks for low-code/ no-code search suffers from several limitations, such as high creation and maintenance cost, lack of superior support for no-code subgraph query formulation, and poor portability across application domains and data sources.2 We introduce the paradigm",
