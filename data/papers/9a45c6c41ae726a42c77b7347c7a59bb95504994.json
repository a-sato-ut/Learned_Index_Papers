    "abstract": "Nowadays, in order to solve the problem of information sharing in heterogeneous systems, federated database is a mature solution. However, the distributed database system also faces many performance bottlenecks. For example, a large amount of data is queried case, and the network transmission cost of data between nodes greatly affects the efficiency of the query. Therefore, how to improve the efficiency of distributed query becomes a problem that needs to be solved. This paper presents a query optimization method based on computational push-down for join query in federated database. The method select a proper query optimization policy based on global statistics, reducing the amount of data transmitted between nodes and greatly improving query efficiency.",
