    "abstract": "As networks get more complex, the ability to track almost all the flows is becoming of paramount importance. This is because we can then detect transient events impacting only a subset of the traffic. Solutions for flow monitoring exist, but it is getting very difficult to produce accurate estimations for every  tuple given the memory constraints of commodity programmable switches. Indeed, as networks grow in size, more flows have to be tracked, increasing the number of tuples to be recorded. At the same time, end-host virtualization requires more specific flowIDs, enlarging the memory cost for every single entry. Finally, the available memory resources have to be shared with other important functions as well (e.g., load balancing, forwarding, ACL). To address those issues, we present FlowLiDAR (Flow Lightweight Detection and Ranging), a new solution that is capable of tracking almost all the flows in the network while requiring only a modest amount of data plane memory which is not dependent on the size of flowIDs. We implemented the scheme in P4, tested it using real traffic from ISPs and compared it against four state-of-the-art solutions: FlowRadar, NZE, PR-sketch, and Elastic Sketch. While those can only reconstruct up to 60% of the tuples, FlowLiDAR can track 98.7% of them with the same amount of memory.",
