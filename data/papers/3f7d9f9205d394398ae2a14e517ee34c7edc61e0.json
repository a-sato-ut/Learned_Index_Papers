    "abstract": "Conversational search supports multi-turn user-system interactions to solve complex information needs. Compared with the traditional single-turn ad-hoc search, conversational search faces a more complex search intent understanding problem because a conversational search session is much longer and contains many noisy tokens. However, existing conversational dense retrieval solutions simply fine-tune the pre-trained ad-hoc query encoder on limited conversational search data, which are hard to achieve satisfactory performance in such a complex conversational search scenario. Meanwhile, the learned latent representation also lacks interpretability that people cannot perceive how the model understands the session. To tackle the above drawbacks, we propose a sparse Lexical-based Conversational REtriever (LeCoRE), which extends the SPLADE model with two well-matched multi-level denoising methods uniformly based on knowledge distillation and external query rewrites to generate denoised and interpretable lexical session representation. Extensive experiments on four public conversational search datasets in both normal and zero-shot evaluation settings demonstrate the strong performance of LeCoRE towards more effective and interpretable conversational search.",
