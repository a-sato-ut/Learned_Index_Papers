    "abstract": "A Binary Search Tree is expanded into a KD Tree to handle the multi-dimensional key searches. A discriminator makes the KD tree different from the BST. This discriminator will take branching decisions at every level based on the key search. It can handle multi-dimensional coordinate object searching. K-d trees enable O(klogn) lookup times for the k nearest points to some point x. This is extremely useful, especially in cases where an O(n) lookup time is intractable already. In this work, a kd tree has been created based on how a celestial body is positioned in relation to the sun. It aims at finding the minimum in a particular dimension, searching for a celestial body and its nearest neighbor.",
