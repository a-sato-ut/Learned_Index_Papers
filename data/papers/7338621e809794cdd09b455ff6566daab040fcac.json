    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a highly efficient computing method for game character control with phase-functioned neural networks (PFNN). The primary challenge to accelerate PFNN on mobile platforms is that PFNN dynamically produces weight matrices with an argument, phase, which is individual to each game character. Therefore existing libraries that generally assume frozen weight matrices are inefficient to accelerate PFNN. The situation becomes even worse when multiple characters are present. To address the challenges, we reformulate the equations and leverage the deep learning compiler stack TVM to build a cross-platform, high-performance implementation. Evaluations reveal that our solutions deliver close-to-peak performance on various platforms, from high-performance servers to energy-efficient mobile platforms.
