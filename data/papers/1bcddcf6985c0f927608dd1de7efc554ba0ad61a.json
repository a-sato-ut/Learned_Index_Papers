    "abstract": "Recommender systems have become a fundamental service in most E-Commerce platforms, in which the matching stage aims to retrieve potentially relevant candidate items to users for further ranking. Recently, some efforts on extracting multi-interests from user's historical behaviors have demonstrated superior performance. However, the historical behaviors are not noise-free due to the possible misclicks or disturbances. Existing works mainly overlook the fact that the interests of a user are not only reflected by the historical behaviors, but also inherently regulated by the profile information. Hence, we are interested in exploiting the benefit of user profile in multi-interest learning to enhance candidate matching performance. To this end, a user-aware multi-interest learning framework (named UMI) is proposed in this paper to exploit both user profile and behavior information for candidate matching. Specifically, UMI consists of two main components: dual-attention routing and interest refinement. In the dual-attention routing, we firstly introduce a user-guided attention network to identify the important historical items with respect to the user profile. Then, the resultant importance weights are leveraged via the dual-attentive capsule network to extract the user's multi-interests. Afterwards, the extracted interests are utilized to highlight the corresponding user profile features for interest refinement, such that different user profiles can be incorporated into interest learning for diverse user preference understanding. Besides, to improve the model's discriminative capacity, we further devise a harder-negatives strategy to support model optimization. Extensive experiments show that UMI significantly outperforms state-of-the-art multi-interest modeling alternatives. Currently, UMI has been successfully deployed at Taobao App in Alibaba, serving hundreds of millions of users.",
