    "abstract": "Technology has changed rapidly and has changed the way we store, manage and read data. Data management is one of the most attractive aspects of cloud computing and is an alternative to the problem faced by database platforms, which can be scaled, modularized, and inexpensive. In this research paper, we will learn the main reasons why databases to cloud migration has taken place and the pros and cons of it. In the past few years, cloud computing has changed the way organizations hold, store and use data. The era of databases is fast changing and the core of data management in companies are being dispensed with. There are many good reasons why cloud databases are the preferred choice for today’s businesses.",
