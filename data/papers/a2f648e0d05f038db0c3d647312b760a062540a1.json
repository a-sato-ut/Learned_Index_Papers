    "abstract": "Machine learning models risk encoding unfairness on the part of their developers or data sources. However, assessing fairness is challenging as analysts might misidentify sources of bias, fail to notice them, or misapply metrics. In this paper we introduce Silva, a system for exploring potential sources of unfairness in datasets or machine learning models interactively. Silva directs user attention to relationships between attributes through a global causal view, provides interactive recommendations, presents intermediate results, and visualizes metrics. We describe the implementation of Silva, identify salient design and technical challenges, and provide an evaluation of the tool in comparison to an existing fairness optimization tool.",
