    "abstract": "Due to their attractiveness, video advertisements are adored by advertisers. Baidu, as one of the leading search advertisement platforms in China, is putting more and more effort into video advertisements for its advertisement customers. Search-based video advertisement display is, in essence, a cross-modal retrieval problem, which is normally tackled through joint embedding methods. Nevertheless, due to the lack of interactions between text features and image features, joint embedding methods cannot achieve as high accuracy as its counterpart based on attention. Inspired by the great success achieved by BERT in NLP tasks, many cross-modal BERT models emerge and achieve excellent performance in cross-modal retrieval. Last year, Baidu also launched a cross-modal BERT, CAN, in video advertisement platform, and achieved considerably better performance than the previous joint-embedding model. In this paper, we present our recent work for video advertisement retrieval, Multi-modal Dictionary BERT (MDBERT) model. Compared with CAN and other cross-modal BERT models, MDBERT integrates a joint dictionary, which is shared among video features and word features. It maps the relevant word features and video features into the same codeword and thus fosters effective cross-modal attention. To support end-to-end training, we propose to soften the codeword assignment. Meanwhile, to enhance the inference efficiency, we adopt the product quantization to achieve fine-level feature space partition at a low cost. After launching MDBERT in Baidu video advertising platform, the conversion ratio (CVR) increases by 3.34%, bringing a considerable revenue boost for advertisers in Baidu.",
