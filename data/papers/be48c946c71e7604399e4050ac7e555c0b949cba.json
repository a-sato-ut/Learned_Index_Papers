    "abstract": "In the ever-growing realm of the Internet of Things (IoT), ensuring the security of interconnected devices is of paramount importance. This paper discusses the process of spotting cyber breaches in IoT devices, a significant concern that needs urgent attention due to the susceptibility of these devices to hacking and other cyber threats. With billions of IoT devices worldwide, the detection and prevention of cybersecurity breaches are critical for maintaining the integrity and functionality of networks and systems. In this paper, we showcase the outcomes achieved by employing the LightGBM technique for a cyberattack prediction challenge, which was a part of the FedCSIS 2023 conference.",
