    "abstract": "In this study, we propose a novel perceptual encryption method for face images with style mixing via Style-GAN2 using the pixel2style2pixel (pSp) encoder. Our method generates natural fake face images by replacing specific latent vectors, ensuring privacy protection while allowing decryption by authorized users. Experimental results using CelebA-HQ dataset and Cross-Age Celebrity Dataset (CACD) demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in maintaining image quality and privacy.",
