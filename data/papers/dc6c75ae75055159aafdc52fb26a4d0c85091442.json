    "abstract": "Recent advances in AI techniques, along with the development of enabling hardware and infrastructure, have facilitated the integration of AI across a wide range of domains and tasks. Specifically, AI has been employed to process various types of data, including numerical, textual, and image data, and has been adopted in large-scale distributed systems. From a data management perspective, this requires the use of cutting-edge AI solutions for data management tasks and systems. aiDM is a full-day workshop that provides a platform for innovative interdisciplinary research on the interaction between AI and data management, and the development of new AI technologies for data-related tasks. This year, aiDM'25 will focus on the transparent application of AI techniques (e.g., utilizing Generative AI frameworks) for data management in enterprise-level workloads.",
