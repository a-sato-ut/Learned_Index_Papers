    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems have gained significant traction in the recent past, creating new challenges in requirements engineering (RE) when building AI software systems. RE for AI practices have not been studied much and have scarce empirical studies. Additionally, many AI software solutions tend to focus on the technical aspects and ignore human-centered values. In this paper, we report on a case study for eliciting and modeling requirements using our framework and a supporting tool for human-centred RE for AI systems. Our case study is a mobile health application for encouraging type-2 diabetic people to reduce their sedentary behavior. We conducted our study with three experts from the app team -- a software engineer, a project manager and a data scientist. We found in our study that most human-centered aspects were not originally considered when developing the first version of the application. We also report on other insights and challenges faced in RE for the health application, e.g., frequently changing requirements.",
