    "abstract": "How to perform similarity search on high-dimensional data is a great challenge, especially for Euclidean distance, although the traditional E2LSH algorithm can cope with this problem well, the value of the parameter has a great influence on its effect. In this regard, a hash bucket parameter selection algorithm incorporating the Gaussian kernel function is proposed for its parameter selection problem, which improves the sensitivity to the data to obtain more accurate and efficient nearest neighbor search results in multi-distributed high dimensional data. Meanwhile, experimental comparisons with other similar algorithms are conducted on a common dataset, and their results show that the optimized E2LSH algorithm demonstrates improved performance in terms of speed and efficiency.",
