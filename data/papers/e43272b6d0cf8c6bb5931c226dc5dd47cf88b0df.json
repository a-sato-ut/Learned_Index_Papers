    "abstract": "In the metaverse the physical space and the virtual space co-exist, and interact simultaneously. While the physical space is virtually enhanced with information, the virtual space is continuously refreshed with real-time, real-world information. To allow users to process and manipulate information seamlessly between the real and digital spaces, novel technologies must be developed. These include smart interfaces, new augmented realities, and efficient data storage, management, and dissemination techniques. In this paper, we first discuss some promising co-space applications. These applications offer opportunities that neither of the spaces can realize on its own. We then discuss challenges. Finally, we discuss and envision what are likely to be required from the database and system perspectives.",
