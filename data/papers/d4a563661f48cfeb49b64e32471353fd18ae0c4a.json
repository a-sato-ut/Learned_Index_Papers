    "abstract": "The process of storing and retrieving information is crucial, and storing it in a coded manner makes it safe and ensures that the mechanism of storage and retrieval technique is practical and straightforward. This research proposes a DNA computing-based practical technique for encryption, auto-storing, and auto-retrieval. It uses an HDC-HP (Hybrid DNA Computing and Hypernetwork) approach. The properties of the graph may be used to identify the various locations in the memory where information is stored, and a decent means of even encrypting and storing information is discovered. Compared to other storage media, DNA is far more powerful and supports highly parallel processing. Consider a few fascinating issues that have applications in both theoretical and practical disciplines to aid physicists, scientists, mathematicians, chemists, biologists, etc. This work uses the benefits of DNA computing and graph theory to store and retrieve data more securely and effectively. With a retrieval accuracy of 98.7%, the HDC- HP method produced an exceptional result.",
