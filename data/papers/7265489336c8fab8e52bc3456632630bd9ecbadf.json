    "abstract": "In this paper, we provide informed arguments for using columnar in-memory database technology, in particular the Hyrise database, for the high-performant implementation of the highly combinatorial data mining tool GrandReport. In service of that we provide a targeted review of columnar databases, a targeted review of columnar in-memory databases, and a comparison of nine established columnar in-memory databases. On the basis of this, we discuss advantages of using the Hyrise database as the future implementation platform for the GrandReport tool.",
