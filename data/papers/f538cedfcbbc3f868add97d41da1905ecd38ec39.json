    "abstract": "We analyse Semantic Segmentation Neural Networks running on an autonomous aircraft to estimate its 6DOF pose during landing. We show that automated reasoning techniques from neural network verification can be used to analyse the conditions under which the networks can operate safely, thus providing enhanced assurance guarantees on the behaviour of the overall pose estimation systems.",
