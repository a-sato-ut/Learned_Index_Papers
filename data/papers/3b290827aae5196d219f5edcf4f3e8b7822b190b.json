    "abstract": "Approximate nearest-neighbor search (ANNS) algorithms are a key part of the modern deep learning stack due to enabling efficient similarity search over high-dimensional vector space representations (i.e., embeddings) of data. Among various ANNS algorithms, graph-based algorithms are known to achieve the best throughput-recall tradeoffs. Despite the large scale of modern ANNS datasets, existing parallel graph-based implementations suffer from significant challenges to scale to large datasets due to heavy use of locks and other sequential bottlenecks, which 1) prevents them from efficiently scaling to a large number of processors, and 2) results in non-determinism that is undesirable in certain applications. In this paper, we introduce ParlayANN, a library of deterministic and parallel graph-based approximate nearest neighbor search algorithms, along with a set of useful tools for developing such algorithms. In this library, we develop novel parallel implementations for four state-of-the-art graph-based ANNS algorithms that scale to billion-scale datasets. Our algorithms are deterministic and achieve high scalability across a diverse set of challenging datasets. In addition to the new algorithmic ideas, we also conduct a detailed experimental study of our new algorithms as well as two existing non-graph approaches. Our experimental results both validate the effectiveness of our new techniques, and lead to a comprehensive comparison among ANNS algorithms on large scale datasets with a list of interesting findings.",
