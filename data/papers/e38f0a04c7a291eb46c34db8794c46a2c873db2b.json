    "abstract": "An essential part of a text generation task is to extract critical information from the text. People usually obtain critical information in the text via manual extraction; however, the asymmetry between the ability to process information manually and the speed of information growth makes it impossible. This problem can be solved by automatic keyphrase extraction. In this paper, the mainstream unsupervised methods to extract keyphrases are summarized, and we analyze in detail the reasons for the differences in the performance of methods then provided some solutions.",
