    "abstract": "To provide applications with the ability to analyze fresh data and eliminate the time-consuming ETL workflow, hybrid transactional and analytical (HTAP) systems have been developed to serve online transaction processing and online analytical processing workloads in a single system. In recent years, HTAP systems have attracted considerable interest from both academia and industry. Several new architectures and technologies have been proposed. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of these HTAP systems. We review recently published papers and technical reports in this field and broadly classify existing HTAP systems into two categories based on their data formats: monolithic and hybrid HTAP. We further classify hybrid HTAP into four sub-categories based on their storage architecture: row-oriented, column-oriented, separated, and hybrid. Based on such a taxonomy, we outline each stream’s design challenges and performance issues (e.g., the contradictory format demand for monolithic HTAP). We then discuss potential solutions and their trade-offs by reviewing noteworthy research findings. Finally, we summarize emerging HTAP applications, benchmarks, future trends, and open problems.",
