    "abstract": "Breadth-First Search (BFS) is one of the most important graph processing subroutines, with a primary application in computing unweighted distances. Many applications may require running BFSs from multiple sources, such as using BFS for low-diameter decomposition [10], all-pair shortest paths (APSP), or computing distance oracles. The problem that performs BFS computations from a cluster of sources is referred to as the cluster-BFS (or C-BFS).",
