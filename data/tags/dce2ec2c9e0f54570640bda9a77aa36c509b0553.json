  "title": "Learning-Aided Heuristics Design for Storage System",
  "abstract": "Computer systems such as storage systems normally require transparent white-box algorithms that are interpretable for human experts. In this work, we propose a learning-aided heuristic design method, which automatically generates human-readable strategies from Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agents. This method benefits from the power of deep learning but avoids the shortcoming of its black-box property. Besides the white-box advantage, experiments in our storage production's resource allocation scenario also show that this solution outperforms the system's default settings and the elaborately handcrafted strategy by human experts.",
