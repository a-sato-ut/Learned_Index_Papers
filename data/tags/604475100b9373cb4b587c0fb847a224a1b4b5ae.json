  "title": "Accelerating Learned Join with FPGAs in Relational Databases",
  "abstract": "In relational database management systems (DBMS), the join operation is of utmost importance as it merges rows from two different tables into a unified dataset. This procedure is executed by pinpointing a shared column that serves as a link between the tables involved. Consequently, the join operation enables the simultaneous retrieval and accessibility of information from multiple tables. Accelerating joins in DBMS improves query performance, reduces response time, and efficiently handles large datasets. This is important for applications that require real-time data processing and analytics. This paper introduces a novel framework designed for accelerating the join operation using a learned index. This approach, which is called LIJA (Learned Index-based Join Acceleration), can significantly improve the join operations across multiple tables, speeding up the execution time. In our experimental analysis, we thoroughly assess the CPU efficiency of our approach, comparing it with traditional methods such as hash-join, merge-join, nested-loop join, and partition-wise join techniques. Employing LIJA, our research uncovered about a 14.9 × enhancement in performance during the build phase, along with an over 1.8 × speedup during the probe phase when assessed using SOSD benchmark datasets. However, as data sizes grow, this often leads to longer runtime and higher memory consumption. These challenges motivated us to leverage FPGA technology to accelerate the build phase of our learned join approach. After this implementation, we evaluated and compared its efficiency with CPUs. Our results indicated that with the FPGA-based learned join accelerator, we attained an approximate 4.4 × speedup during the build phase, and total speedup of 6.63 × over the CPU-based implementation.",
