  "title": "PANDA: Facilitating Usable AI Development",
  "abstract": "Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning have created a general perception that AI could be used to solve complex problems, and in some situations over-hyped as a tool that can be so easily used. Unfortunately, the barrier to realization of mass adoption of AI on various business domains is too high because most domain experts have no background in AI. Developing AI applications involves multiple phases, namely data preparation, application modeling, and product deployment. The effort of AI research has been spent mostly on new AI models (in the model training stage) to improve the performance of benchmark tasks such as image recognition. Many other factors such as usability, efficiency and security of AI have not been well addressed, and therefore form a barrier to democratizing AI. Further, for many real world applications such as healthcare and autonomous driving, learning via huge amounts of possibility exploration is not feasible since humans are involved. In many complex applications such as healthcare, subject matter experts (e.g. Clinicians) are the ones who appreciate the importance of features that affect health, and their knowledge together with existing knowledge bases are critical to the end results. In this paper, we take a new perspective on developing AI solutions, and present a solution for making AI usable. We hope that this resolution will enable all subject matter experts (eg. Clinicians) to exploit AI like data scientists.",
