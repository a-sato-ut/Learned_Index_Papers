  "title": "Adversarially Robust Bloom Filters: Monotonicity and Betting",
  "abstract": "A Bloom filter is a probabilistic data structure designed to provide a compact representation of a set S of elements from a large universe U. The trade-off for this succinctness is allowing some errors. The Bloom filter efficiently answers membership queries: given any query x, if x is in S, it must answer ’Yes’; if x is not in S, it should answer ’Yes’ only with a small probability (at most ε).\n Traditionally, the error probability of the Bloom filter is analyzed under the assumption that the query is independent of its internal randomness. However, Naor and Yogev (Crypto 2015) focused on the behavior of this data structure in adversarial settings; where the adversary may choose the queries adaptively. One particular challenge in this direction is to define rigorously the robustness of Bloom filters in this model.\n In this work, we continue investigating the definitions of success of the adaptive adversary. Specifically, we focus on two notions proposed by Naor and Oved (TCC 2022) and examine the relationships between them. In particular, we highlight the notion of Bet-or-Pass as being stronger than others, such as Monotone-Test Resilience.",
