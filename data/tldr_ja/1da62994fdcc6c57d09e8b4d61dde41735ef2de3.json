  "abstract": "Functional (aka immutable) data structures are used extensively in data management systems. From distributed systems to data persistence, immutability makes complex programs significantly easier to reason about and implement. However, immutability also makes many runtime optimizations like tree rebalancing, or adaptive organizations, unreasonably expensive. In this paper, we propose Fluid data structures, an approach to data structure design that allows limited physical changes that preserve logical equivalence. As we will show, this approach retains many of the desirable properties of functional data structures, while also allowing runtime adaptation. To illustrate Fluid data structures, we work through the design of a lazy-loading map that we call a Fluid Cog. A Fluid Cog is a lock-free data structure that incrementally organizes itself in the background by applying equivalence-preserving structural transformations. Our experimental analysis shows that the resulting map structure is flexible enough to adapt to a variety of performance goals, while remaining competitive with existing structures like the C++ standard template library map.",
  "tldr_ja": "流体データ構造は、論理的同値を保ちながら物理的変更を許可するデータ構造設計のアプローチであり、機能的データ構造の利点を維持しつつ、実行時の適応を可能にします。この研究では、自己組織化するロックフリーの「Fluid Cog」という遅延読み込みマップを提案し、既存の構造と競争力のある性能を示しています。"
