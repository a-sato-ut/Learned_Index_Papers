  "abstract": "The future of computing is anticipated to be shaped by the fusion of DBMS (Database Management Systems) and AI (Artificial Intelligence). This union is of utmost importance to advance DBMS technology and enable next-generation computing Although DBMS and AI systems are well-established\n technology, research, and development into the combination of AI and databases is still in its early phases. The availability of vast volumes of shared data for knowledge processing, effective data, knowledge management, and intelligent data processing is the driving force behind this convergence.\n The Intelligent Database Interface (IDI) architecture was developed to protect the significant investments made in current databases. Numerous well-liked techniques and developments for fusing AI with databases have been examined in-depth through extensive study and published articles.",
