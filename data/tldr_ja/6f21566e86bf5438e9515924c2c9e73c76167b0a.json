  "title": "Learned Indexes From the One-dimensional to the Multi-dimensional Spaces: Challenges, Techniques, and Opportunities",
  "abstract": "Recently, the class of learned index structures has emerged as one form of database indexes that make use of Machine Learning (ML) techniques. The learned indexes designed for the one-dimensional space have demonstrated improvements in both the query processing time and the index size. Observing the advantages of one-dimensional learned indexes, various learned indexes have been proposed for the multi-dimensional space. This class of learned indexes is termed ''Learned Multi-dimensional Indexes.'' This tutorial on learned indexes is designed based on our long survey article on the subject [4]. In this tutorial, we use a taxonomy to categorize over 100 learned one- and multi-dimensional indexes with more focus on the class of learned multi-dimensional indexes. The goal of this tutorial is to explain the fundamental techniques behind state-of-the-art learned one- and multi-dimensional indexes with emphasis on the latter, and identify the ongoing challenges and future opportunities for research in this domain.",
