  "title": "Chameleon: Towards Update-Efficient Learned Indexing for Locally Skewed Data",
  "abstract": "Recently, learned indexes are assisting and are being adopted to replace traditional indexes for their low memory usage and high query performance. However, existing learned indexes suffer in query efficiency when dealing with locally skewed data distributions which may be caused or exacerbated by ubiquitous updates. Frequent model retraining and reconstruction is required under this circumstance. To address this issue, we present Chameleon, an adaptive learned index for locally skewed data especially in the context of frequent updates. We propose a metric for measuring local skewness, based on which we employ Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning to assist in locating locally skewed regions and optimizing index structures. Additionally, to reduce the blocking time caused by index model retraining, we propose a lightweight lock named the Interval Lock to achieve a non-blocking retraining. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, without costing more memory, Chameleon outperforms the state-of-the-art learned indexes by up to 3.75 x and 4.37 x in lookup times for read-only and mixed workloads, respectively, and it accelerates update processing by up to 2.92 x.",
