  "title": "Learning Everywhere: Pervasive Machine Learning for Effective High-Performance Computation",
  "abstract": "The convergence of HPC and data intensive methodologies provide a promising approach to major performance improvements. This paper provides a general description of the interaction between traditional HPC and ML approaches and motivates the \"Learning Everywhere\" paradigm for HPC. We introduce the concept of \"effective performance\" that one can achieve by combining learning methodologies with simulation based approaches, and distinguish between traditional performance as measured by benchmark scores. To support the promise of integrating HPC and learning methods, this paper examines specific examples and opportunities across a series of domains. It concludes with a series of open software systems, methods and infrastructure challenges that the Learning Everywhere paradigm presents.",
  "tldr_ja": "本論文は、高性能計算（HPC）とデータ集約型手法の融合がもたらす性能向上の可能性を探求し、「Learning Everywhere」パラダイムを提唱します。学習手法とシミュレーションを組み合わせることで得られる「効果的な性能」を定義し、具体例を通じてHPCと機械学習の統合の機会を示します。また、関連するソフトウェアシステムやインフラの課題についても言及しています。"
