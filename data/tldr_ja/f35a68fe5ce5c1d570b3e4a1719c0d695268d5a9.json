  "title": "Can LLMs Replace Time-Tested System Policies? Perhaps",
  "abstract": "System policies—such as scheduling, caching, and resource allocation—play a critical role in determining performance and efficiency. Traditionally, these policies are implemented using handcrafted heuristics designed to perform reasonably well across general workloads. While tech giants invest substantial resources in customizing operating systems and other systems for their particular workloads, such optimization remains out of reach for most organizations and individuals. In this paper, we argue that Large Language Models (LLMs) enable a promising paradigm: a centralized decision engine that generalizes across diverse system tasks. A unified LLM architecture could let operating systems and other software adapt to workload changes, optimize policies globally, and improve continuously without manual tuning. Realizing this vision poses challenges in system integration, latency, inter-pretability, and safety. We offer a first step toward unipolicy systems, where a single foundation model governs policy decisions across the system stack.",
