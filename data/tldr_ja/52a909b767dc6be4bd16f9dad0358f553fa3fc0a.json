  "title": "Replicated Layout for In-Memory Database Systems",
  "abstract": "Scanning and filtering are the foundations of analytical database systems. Modern DBMSs employ a variety of techniques to partition and layout data to improve the performance of these operations. To accelerate query performance, systems tune data layout to reduce the cost of accessing and processing data. However, these layouts optimize for the average query, and with heterogeneous data access patterns in parts of the data, their performance degrades. To mitigate this, we present CopyRight, a layout-aware partial replication engine that replicates parts of the data differently and lays out each replica differently to maximize the overall query performance. Across a range of real-world query workloads, CopyRight is able to achieve 1.1X to 7.9X faster performance than the best non-replicated layout with 0.25X space overhead. When compared to full table replication with 100% overhead, CopyRight attains the same or up to 5.2X speedup with 25% space overhead.",
  "tldr_ja": "CopyRightは、データの部分的な複製とレイアウトを最適化するエンジンで、異なるアクセスパターンに対応し、クエリ性能を最大化します。実際のクエリワークロードにおいて、非複製レイアウトよりも最大7.9倍の高速化を実現し、フルテーブル複製と比較しても25%のスペースオーバーヘッドで同等または最大5.2倍のスピードアップを達成します。"
