  "title": "DRLindex: deep reinforcement learning index advisor for a cluster database",
  "abstract": "Cloud database providers provision different architectures to guarantee high availability. One of these architectures is a cluster database that consists of several database engine nodes, where data is replicated among the nodes. Although the cloud database providers provide various auto-indexing tools, these tools mostly address characteristics of a database deployed on a single node, not a cluster. It is possible to install an index advisor on each node, which recommends an index set for that node. The problem with this approach is that the current index advisors for a single node aim to minimize the processing cost of the workload; however, on a cluster database, other goals such as load balancing can be considered. Hence, the better solution could be an index advisor which has a comprehensive view of the cluster node. In this paper, we propose an index advisor for a replicated database on a database cluster for a read-only workload. The advisor considers both query processing cost and load balancing. It utilizes a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approach in which a DRL agent learns to select a set of index configurations for nodes in a cluster. We describe the components of the DRL-advisor such as the agent, the environment, a set of actions, the reward function, and other modules. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the algorithm.",
