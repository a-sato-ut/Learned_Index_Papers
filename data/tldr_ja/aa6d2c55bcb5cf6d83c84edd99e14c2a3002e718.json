  "title": "Oasis: An Optimal Disjoint Segmented Learned Range Filter",
  "abstract": "The learning-enhanced data structure has inspired the development of the range filter, bringing significantly better false positive rate (FPR) than traditional non-learned range filters. Its core idea is to employ piece-wise linear functions that uniformly map the entire key space into a bitmap sequentially. Nonetheless, such uniform mapping can be space-ineffective, impacting FPRs.\n This paper introduces Oasis, a novel learned range filter that divides the key space into disjointed intervals by excluding large empty ranges explicitly and optimally maps those unpruned intervals into a compressed bitmap. The configuration optimality in Oasis is guaranteed by a careful theoretical analysis. To enhance the versatility of Oasis, we further propose Oasis+, which integrates the design space of both learned and non-learned filters, delivering robust performance across a wide range of workloads. We evaluate the performance of both Oasis and Oasis+ when integrated into the key-value system RocksDB, using a diverse set of real-world and synthetic datasets and workloads. In RocksDB, Oasis and Oasis+ improve the performance by up to 1.4× and 6.2× when compared to state-of-the-art learned and non-learned range filters.",
