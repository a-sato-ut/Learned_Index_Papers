  "title": "A Survey of Multi-Dimensional Indexes: Past and Future Trends",
  "abstract": "Index structures are powerful tools for improving query performance and reducing disk access in database systems. Multi-dimensional indexes, in particular, are used to filter records effectively based on multiple attributes. Classical multi-dimensional index structures, such as KD-Tree, Quadtree, and R-Tree, have been widely used in modern databases. However, advancements in hardware and algorithms have led to the emergence of new types of multi-dimensional index structures. In this paper, we begin by reviewing classical multi-dimensional indexes. Next, we explore the approaches that leverage modern hardware features, such as Solid-State Drive, Non-Volatile Memory, Dynamic Random Access Memory, and Graphics Processing Unit, to improve the performance of multi-dimensional indexes in various aspects. Then, we investigate the novel work of multi-dimensional indexes that apply state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. Finally, we discuss the challenges and future research directions for multi-dimensional indexing methods.",
