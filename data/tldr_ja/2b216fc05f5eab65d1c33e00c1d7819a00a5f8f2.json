  "title": "ChainedFilter: Combining Membership Filters by Chain Rule",
  "abstract": "Membership (membership query/membership testing) is a fundamental problem across databases, networks and security. However, previous research has primarily focused on either approximate solutions, such as Bloom Filters, or exact methods, like perfect hashing and dictionaries, without attempting to develop an integral theory. In this paper, we propose a unified and complete theory, namely chain rule, for general membership problems, which encompasses both approximate and exact membership as extreme cases. Building upon the chain rule, we introduce a straightforward yet versatile algorithm framework, namely ChainedFilter, to combine different elementary filters without losing information. Our evaluation results demonstrate that ChainedFilter improves performance of many applications including static dictionary, lossless data compression, Cuckoo Hashing, LSM-Tree and Learned Filters.",
  "tldr_ja": "本論文では、会員フィルタの問題に対して、近似解と正確解を統合する「チェインルール」という理論を提案します。これに基づき、情報を失うことなく異なるフィルタを組み合わせる「ChainedFilter」アルゴリズムを導入し、静的辞書やデータ圧縮など多くのアプリケーションで性能向上を実証しました。"
