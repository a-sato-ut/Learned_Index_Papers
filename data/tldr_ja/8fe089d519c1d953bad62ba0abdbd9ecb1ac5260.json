  "title": "Demonstrating λ-Tune: Exploiting Large Language Models for Workload-Adaptive Database System Tuning",
  "abstract": "We demonstrate λ-Tune, a tool that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated, workload-adaptive database system tuning. λ-Tune harnesses the ability of LLMs to process and comprehend arbitrary textual data in a zero-shot manner, employing a workload-adaptive optimization approach. Given a database system, the hardware specifications, and a set of queries, λ-Tune generates prompts to retrieve configuration recommendations for the tuning knobs and the physical design, tailored to the specific system and workload. Our framework utilizes a workload compression approach that extracts and includes in the prompt only the most insightful workload characteristics, while the prompt size can be adjusted by a user-defined token budget. Utilizing the zero-shot capabilities of LLMs, λ-Tune outperforms other LLM and machine learning-enhanced database tuning baselines, which rely on time-consuming tuning and training phases, as well as expensive hardware, such as GPUs. During demonstration, users will be able to experiment with λ-Tune to tune Postgres and MySQL, as well as explore and modify the configurations retrieved by the LLM in an interactive way through λ-Tune's user interface.",
