  "title": "Northstar: An Interactive Data Science System",
  "abstract": "In order to democratize data science, we need to fundamentally rethink the current analytics stack, from the user interface to the \"guts.\" Most importantly, enabling a broader range of users to unfold the potential of (their) data requires a change in the interface and the \"protection\" we offer them. On the one hand, visual interfaces for data science have to be intuitive, easy, and interactive to reach users without a strong background in computer science or statistics. On the other hand, we need to protect users from making false discoveries. Furthermore, it requires that technically involved (and often boring) tasks have to be automatically done by the system so that the user can focus on contributing their domain expertise to the problem. In this paper, we present Northstar, the Interactive Data Science System, which we have developed over the last 4 years to explore designs that make advanced analytics and model building more accessible.",
