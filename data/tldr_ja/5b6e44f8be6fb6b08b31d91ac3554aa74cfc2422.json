  "title": "Deft: A Scalable Tree Index for Disaggregated Memory",
  "abstract": "Memory disaggregation has become an inexorable trend in data centers and the cloud. By physically separating compute and memory resources into independent pools and connecting them with high-speed networks, memory disaggregation enables high resource utilization and elastic resource scaling. However, traditional tree-based indexes become inefficient on disaggregated memory: (1) large tree nodes can easily saturate network bandwidth due to I/O amplification, yet small tree nodes increase network round trips; (2) expensive concurrency control schemes restrict the scalability. We present Deft, a tree-based index for disaggregated memory that delivers high throughput and scalability. Deft 1) introduces segmented internal nodes and hash-based leaf nodes for fine-grained access patterns to achieve low I/O amplification without increasing the index height; 2) proposes a scalable write-write concurrency control scheme on top of the tailored node structure with a one-sided shared-exclusive lock, improving scalability for concurrent update and insert operations; 3) proposes a lightweight and correct read-write concurrency control scheme, improving scalability for efficient lock-free search operations. Our experimental results demonstrate that Deft achieves high performance and scalability on disaggregated memory, and outperforms state-of-the-art ordered indexes by 2.4-9.5× under various workloads.",
