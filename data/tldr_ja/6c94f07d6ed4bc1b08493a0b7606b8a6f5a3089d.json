  "title": "Aleph Filter: To Infinity in Constant Time",
  "abstract": "Filter data structures are widely used in various areas of computer science to answer approximate set-membership queries. In many applications, the data grows dynamically, requiring their filters to expand along with the data. However, existing methods for expanding filters cannot maintain stable performance, memory footprint, and false positive rate (FPR) simultaneously. We address this problem with Aleph Filter, which makes the following contributions. (1) It supports all operations (insertions, queries, deletes, etc.) in constant time, no matter how much the data grows. (2) Given an estimate of how much the data will ultimately grow, Aleph Filter provides a memory vs. FPR trade-offs on par with static filters.",
  "tldr_ja": "Aleph Filterは、動的に成長するデータに対応したフィルタデータ構造で、挿入、クエリ、削除を常に定数時間で実行可能です。また、データの成長予測に基づき、メモリ使用量と偽陽性率のトレードオフを静的フィルタと同等に提供します。これにより、安定した性能を維持しつつ、メモリとFPRの最適化が可能です。"
