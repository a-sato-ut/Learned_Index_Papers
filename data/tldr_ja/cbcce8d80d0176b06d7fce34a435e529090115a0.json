  "title": "Online Scheduling via Learned Weights",
  "abstract": "Online algorithms are a hallmark of worst case optimization under uncertainty. On the other hand, in practice, the input is often far from worst case, and has some predictable characteristics. A recent line of work has shown how to use machine learned predictions to circumvent strong lower bounds on competitive ratios in classic online problems such as ski rental and caching. We study how predictive techniques can be used to break through worst case barriers in online scheduling. The makespan minimization problem with restricted assignments is a classic problem in online scheduling theory. Worst case analysis of this problem gives Ω(log m ) lower bounds on the competitive ratio in the online setting. We identify a robust quantity that can be predicted and then used to guide online algorithms to achieve better performance. Our predictions are compact in size, having dimension linear in the number of machines, and can be learned using standard oﬀ the shelf methods. The performance guarantees of our algorithms depend on the accuracy of the predictions, given predictions with error η , we show how to construct O (log η ) competitive fractional assignments. We then give an online algorithm that rounds any fractional assignment into an integral schedule. Our algorithm is O ((log log m ) 3 )-competitive and we give a nearly matching ˜Ω(log log m ) lower bound for online rounding algorithms. 1 Altogether, we give algorithms that, equipped with predictions with error η , achieve O (log η (log log m ) 3 ) competitive ratios, breaking the Ω(log m ) lower bound even for moderately accurate predictions.",
