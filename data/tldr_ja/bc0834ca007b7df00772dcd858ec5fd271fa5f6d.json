  "title": "NoSQL Technologies in Big Data Ecosystems: a Comprehensive Review of Architectural Paradigms and Performance Metrics",
  "abstract": "The exponential growth of data in volume, velocity, and variety has challenged traditional relational database management systems, leading to the emergence and widespread adoption of NoSQL and other innovative database technologies. This article provides a comprehensive review of NoSQL databases and their role in modern Big Data infrastructure stacks. Through a systematic analysis of current literature and industry case studies, we explore the architectural paradigms, performance metrics, and use cases of various NoSQL database types, including document-based, key-value, column-family, and graph\ndatabases. Our findings indicate that NoSQL solutions offer significant advantages in scalability, flexibility, and real-time processing capabilities, particularly for unstructured and semi-structured data.\nHowever, challenges persist in areas such as data consistency, security, and interoperability with existing systems. We also examine emerging trends, including NewSQL, time-series databases, and the integration\nof artificial intelligence in database management. This article contributes to the understanding of how organizations can leverage NoSQL technologies to optimize their Big Data infrastructure, highlighting both the opportunities and considerations for implementation. Our conclusions underscore the\ntransformative impact of NoSQL on data management practices and provide directions for future research in this rapidly evolving field.",
