  "title": "Efficient Cost Modeling of Space-filling Curves",
  "abstract": "\n A\n space-filling curve\n (SFC) maps points in a multi-dimensional space to one-dimensional points by discretizing the multi-dimensional space into cells and imposing a linear order on the cells. This way, an SFC enables computing a one-dimensional layout for multidimensional data storage and retrieval. Choosing an appropriate SFC is crucial, as different SFCs have different effects on query performance. Currently, there are two primary strategies: 1) deterministic schemes, which are computationally efficient but often yield suboptimal query performance, and 2) dynamic schemes, which consider a broad range of candidate SFCs based on cost functions but incur significant computational overhead. Despite these strategies, existing methods cannot efficiently measure the effectiveness of SFCs under heavy query workloads and numerous SFC options.\n \n \n To address this problem, we propose means of\n constant-time\n cost estimations that can enhance existing SFC selection algorithms, enabling them to learn more effective SFCs. Additionally, we propose an SFC learning method that leverages reinforcement learning and our cost estimations to choose an SFC pattern efficiently. Experimental studies offer evidence of the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed means of cost estimation and SFC learning.\n",
