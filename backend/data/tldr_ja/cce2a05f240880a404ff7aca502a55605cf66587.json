  "title": "Outback: Fast and Communication-efficient Index for Key-Value Store on Disaggregated Memory",
  "abstract": "Disaggregated memory systems achieve resource utilization efficiency and system scalability by distributing computation and memory resources into distinct pools of nodes. RDMA is an attractive solution to support high-throughput communication between different disaggregated resource pools. However, existing RDMA solutions face a dilemma: one-sided RDMA completely bypasses computation at memory nodes, but its communication takes multiple round trips; two-sided RDMA achieves one-round-trip communication but requires non-trivial computation for index lookups at memory nodes, which violates the principle of disaggregated memory. This work presents Outback, a novel indexing solution for key-value stores with a one-round-trip RDMA-based network that does not incur computation-heavy tasks at memory nodes. Outback is the first to utilize dynamic minimal perfect hashing and separates its index into two components: one memory-efficient and compute-heavy component at compute nodes and the other memory-heavy and compute-efficient component at memory nodes. We implement a prototype of Outback and evaluate its performance in a public cloud. The experimental results show that Outback achieves higher throughput than both the state-of-the-art one-sided RDMA and two-sided RDMA-based in-memory KVS by 1.06--5.03×, due to the unique strength of applying a separated perfect hashing index.",
