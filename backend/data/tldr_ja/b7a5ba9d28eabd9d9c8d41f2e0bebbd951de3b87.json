  "title": "A Fully On-Disk Updatable Learned Index",
  "abstract": "While in-memory learned indexes have shown promising performance as compared to B+-tree, most widely used databases in real applications still rely on disk-based operations. From our experiments, we observe that directly applying the ex-isting in-memory learned indexes into on-disk setting suffers from several drawbacks and cannot outperform a standard B+-tree in most cases. Therefore, we make the first attempt to show how the idea of learned index can benefit the on-disk index by proposing AULID, a fully on-disk updatable learned index that can achieve state-of-the-art performance across multiple workload types. The AULID approach combines the benefits from both traditional indexing techniques and the learned indexes to reduce the I/O cost - the main overhead under disk setting. Specifically, three aspects are taken into consideration in reducing I/O costs: (1) reduce the overhead in updating the index structure; (2) induce shorter paths from root to leaf node; (3) achieve better locality to minimize the number of block reads required to complete a scan. Five principles are proposed to guide the design of AULID which shows remarkable performance gains and meanwhile is easy to implement. Our evaluation shows that AULI D has comparable storage costs to a B+-tree and is much smaller than other learned indexes, and AULID is up to 2.11x, 8.63x, 1.72x, 5.51x, and 8.02x more efficient than FITing-tree, PGM, B+-tree, ALEX, and LIPP.",
