  "title": "A Parametrizable Algorithm for Distributed Approximate Similarity Search with Arbitrary Distances",
  "abstract": "Recent studies have explored alternative distance measures for similarity search in spaces with diverse topologies, emphasizing the importance of selecting an appropriate distance function to improve the performance of k-Nearest Neighbour search algorithms. However, a critical gap remains in accommodating such diverse similarity measures, as most existing methods for exact or approximate similarity search are explicitly designed for metric spaces. To address this need, we propose PDASC (Parametrizable Distributed Approximate Similarity Search with Clustering), a novel Approximate Nearest Neighbour search algorithm. PDASC combines an innovative multilevel indexing structure particularly adept at managing outliers, highly imbalanced datasets, and sparse data distributions, with the flexibility to support arbitrary distance functions achieved through the integration of clustering algorithms that inherently accommodate them. Experimental results show that PDASC constitutes a reliable ANN search method, suitable for operating in distributed data environments and for handling datasets defined in different topologies, where the selection of the most appropriate distance function is often non-trivial.",
  "tldr_ja": "PDASC（パラメータ化可能な分散近似類似検索アルゴリズム）は、異なるトポロジーを持つデータセットに対応するため、任意の距離関数をサポートし、外れ値や不均衡なデータを効果的に管理する多層インデックス構造を採用しています。この手法は、分散環境での信頼性の高い近似最近傍検索を実現します。"
