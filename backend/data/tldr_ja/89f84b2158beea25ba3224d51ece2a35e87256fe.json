  "title": "Astrid: Accurate Selectivity Estimation for String Predicates using Deep Learning",
  "abstract": "Accurate selectivity estimation for string predicates is a long-standing research challenge in databases. Supporting pattern matching on strings (such as prefix, substring, and suffix) makes this problem much more challenging, thereby necessitating a dedicated study. Traditional approaches often build pruned summary data structures such as tries followed by selectivity estimation using statistical correlations. However, this produces insufficiently accurate cardinality estimates resulting in the selection of sub-optimal plans by the query optimizer. Recently proposed deep learning based approaches leverage techniques from natural language processing such as embeddings to encode the strings and use it to train a model. While this is an improvement over traditional approaches, there is a large scope for improvement.\n We propose Astrid, a framework for string selectivity estimation that synthesizes ideas from traditional and deep learning based approaches. We make two complementary contributions. First, we propose an embedding algorithm that is query-type (prefix, substring, and suffix) and selectivity aware. Consider three strings 'ab', 'abc' and 'abd' whose prefix frequencies are 1000, 800 and 100 respectively. Our approach would ensure that the embedding for 'ab' is closer to 'abc' than 'abd'. Second, we describe how neural language models could be used for selectivity estimation. While they work well for prefix queries, their performance for substring queries is sub-optimal. We modify the objective function of the neural language model so that it could be used for estimating selectivities of pattern matching queries. We also propose a novel and efficient algorithm for optimizing the new objective function. We conduct extensive experiments over benchmark datasets and show that our proposed approaches achieve state-of-the-art results.",
