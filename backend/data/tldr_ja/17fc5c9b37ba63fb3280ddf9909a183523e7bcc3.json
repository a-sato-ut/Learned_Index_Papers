  "title": "HISTSFC: Optimization for ND Massive Spatial Points Querying",
  "abstract": "Space Filling Curve (SFC) mapping-based clustering and indexing works effectively for point clouds management and querying. It maps both points and queries into a one-dimensional SFC space so that B+- tree could be utilized. Based on the basic structure, this paper develops a generic HistSFC approach which utilizes a histogram tree recording point distribution for efficient querying. The goal is to resolve the issue of skewed data querying. Besides, the paper proposes an agile method to compute a continuous Level of Detail (cLoD), and integrates it into HistSFC to support smooth rendering of massive points. Results indicate that for range queries, HistSFC decreases the False Positive Rate (FPR) of selection by maximally 80%, compared to previous approaches. It also performs significantly faster than the state-of- the-art Oracle SDO_PC solution. With improved performance on visualization and k Nearest Neighbour (kNN) search, HistSFC can therefore be used as a new standard solution.",
  "tldr_ja": "本論文では、空間充填曲線(SFC)に基づく新しいクエリ手法HistSFCを提案し、データの偏りによるクエリ問題を解決します。ヒストグラムツリーを用いることで、範囲クエリの偽陽性率を最大80%削減し、視覚化やk近傍探索の性能を向上させます。HistSFCは、従来の手法と比較して高速で、標準的な解決策としての利用が期待されます。"
