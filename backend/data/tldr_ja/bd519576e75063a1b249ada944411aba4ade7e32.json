  "title": "PerOS: Personalized Self-Adapting Operating Systems in the Cloud",
  "abstract": "Operating systems (OSes) are foundational to computer systems, managing hardware resources and ensuring secure environments for diverse applications. However, despite their enduring importance, the fundamental design objectives of OSes have seen minimal evolution over decades. Traditionally prioritizing aspects like speed, memory efficiency, security, and scalability, these objectives often overlook the crucial aspect of intelligence as well as personalized user experience. The lack of intelligence becomes increasingly critical amid technological revolutions, such as the remarkable advancements in machine learning (ML). Today's personal devices, evolving into intimate companions for users, pose unique challenges for traditional OSes like Linux and iOS, especially with the emergence of specialized hardware featuring heterogeneous components. Furthermore, the rise of large language models (LLMs) in ML has introduced transformative capabilities, reshaping user interactions and software development paradigms. While existing literature predominantly focuses on leveraging ML methods for system optimization or accelerating ML workloads, there is a significant gap in addressing personalized user experiences at the OS level. To tackle this challenge, this work proposes PerOS, a personalized OS ingrained with LLM capabilities. PerOS aims to provide tailored user experiences while safeguarding privacy and personal data through declarative interfaces, self-adaptive kernels, and secure data management in a scalable cloud-centric architecture; therein lies the main research question of this work: How can we develop intelligent, secure, and scalable OSes that deliver personalized experiences to thousands of users?",
  "tldr_ja": "本論文では、パーソナライズされた自己適応型オペレーティングシステム「PerOS」を提案します。従来のOSはユーザー体験の個別化を軽視しており、特に機械学習の進展に伴う新たな課題に対応できていません。PerOSは、プライバシーを守りつつ、クラウド環境でスケーラブルな個別体験を提供することを目指しています。"
