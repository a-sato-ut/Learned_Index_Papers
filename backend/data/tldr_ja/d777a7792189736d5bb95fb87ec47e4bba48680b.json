  "title": "Software-Defined Software: A Perspective of Machine Learning-Based Software Production",
  "abstract": "As the Moore's Law is ending, and increasingly high demand of software development continues in the human society, we are facing two serious challenges in the computing field. First, the general-purpose computing ecosystem that has been developed for more than 50 years will have to be changed by including many diverse devices for various specialties in high performance. Second, human-based software development is not sustainable to respond the requests from all the fields in the society. We envision that we will enter a time of developing high quality software by machines, and we name this as Software-defined Software (SDS). In this paper, we will elaborate our vision, the goals and its roadmap.",
  "tldr_ja": "本論文では、ムーアの法則の終焉とソフトウェア開発の需要増加に伴う二つの課題を指摘し、機械による高品質なソフトウェア開発「ソフトウェア定義ソフトウェア（SDS）」の概念を提唱しています。人間中心の開発の限界を克服するための目標とロードマップを詳述しています。"
