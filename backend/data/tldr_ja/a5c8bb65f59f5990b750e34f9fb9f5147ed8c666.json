  "title": "Meta-Learning Neural Bloom Filters",
  "abstract": "There has been a recent trend in training neural networks to replace data structures that have been crafted by hand, with an aim for faster execution, better accuracy, or greater compression. In this setting, a neural data structure is instantiated by training a network over many epochs of its inputs until convergence. In applications where inputs arrive at high throughput, or are ephemeral, training a network from scratch is not practical. This motivates the need for few-shot neural data structures. In this paper we explore the learning of approximate set membership over a set of data in one-shot via meta-learning. We propose a novel memory architecture, the Neural Bloom Filter, which is able to achieve significant compression gains over classical Bloom Filters and existing memory-augmented neural networks.",
  "tldr_ja": "本論文では、メタ学習を用いて一度の学習で近似的な集合メンバーシップを学習する「Neural Bloom Filter」を提案します。従来のBloomフィルターやメモリ拡張型ニューラルネットワークに比べ、著しい圧縮効果を実現し、高スループットや短命なデータに対応可能な新しいメモリアーキテクチャを示します。"
