We compare traditional cen-\ntralized locking approaches with modern distributed proto cols,\nevaluating them based on throughput, latency, and scalabil ity\nmetrics. Our experimental results demonstrate that optimi zed\ndistributed locking protocols can achieve up to 68% better p er-\nformance compared to centralized approaches in high-conte ntion\nscenarios, while maintaining strong consistency guarante es. Fur-\nthermore, we propose novel optimizations for distributed l ocking\nthat signiﬁcantly reduce coordination overhead in geo-dis tributed\ndeployments. The ﬁndings contribute to the growing body of\nknowledge on designing efﬁcient concurrency control mecha nisms\nfor modern distributed systems.\nIndex Terms —distributed systems, distributed locking, concur-\nrency control, consistency, performance optimization\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nDistributed systems have become ubiquitous in modern\ncomputing infrastructure, powering applications ranging from\nglobal e-commerce platforms to real-time data analytics se r-\nvices [26] [28]. As these systems scale, ensuring data con-\nsistency while maintaining performance becomes increasin gly\nchallenging. Distributed locking protocols play a critica l role\nin managing concurrent access to shared resources across\ndistributed nodes, preventing race conditions and ensurin g\nsystem correctness [1] [14].\nTraditional approaches to distributed locking often rely o n\ncentralized lock managers, which can become bottlenecks in\nhigh-scale environments [5]. More recent approaches distr ibute\nthe locking responsibility across multiple nodes, improvi ng\nscalability but introducing complex coordination challen ges\n[2] [25]. The trade-offs between these approaches represen t\na critical design consideration for system architects.\nIn this paper, we conduct a systematic evaluation of dis-\ntributed locking mechanisms, making the following contrib u-\ntions:\n•A comprehensive analysis of centralized versus dis-\ntributed locking approaches under varying workload pat-\nterns and system scales\n•Novel optimizations for reducing coordination overhead\nin geo-distributed locking scenarios\n•Empirical evaluation using realistic workloads across\nmultiple cloud providers\n•Performance guidelines for selecting appropriate locking\nstrategies based on application characteristics\nOur results demonstrate that while no single approach\nis optimal for all scenarios, carefully designed distribut edprotocols can signiﬁcantly outperform centralized approa ches\nin high-scale environments, particularly when optimized f or\nspeciﬁc workload patterns.\nII. B ACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK\nA. Distributed Locking Fundamentals\nDistributed locking protocols enable multiple processes\nacross a distributed system to coordinate access to shared\nresources. These protocols must address several challenge s\ninherent to distributed environments:\nConsistency guarantees deﬁne the strength of isolation\nprovided when multiple processes access shared data. Stron g\nconsistency models (e.g., strict serializability) provid e guar-\nantees similar to single-node systems but often at the cost o f\nperformance, while weaker models may allow some anomalies\nin exchange for better performance [4] [13].\nThe CAP theorem demonstrates the impossibility of si-\nmultaneously achieving consistency, availability, and pa rtition\ntolerance in distributed systems. Lock protocols must make\nexplicit trade-offs among these properties based on applic ation\nrequirements [6] [12].\nB. Centralized Locking Approaches\nCentralized locking approaches employ a single coordinato r\nresponsible for managing all locks within the system. While\nconceptually simple, these approaches face several limita tions:\n•Single point of failure: The lock manager becomes a\ncritical component whose failure can affect the entire\nsystem\n•Scalability bottlenecks: As system scale increases, the\ncentral lock manager can become overwhelmed with lock\nrequests\n•Network latency: In geo-distributed deployments, remote\nnodes experience higher latency when acquiring locks\nDespite these limitations, centralized approaches remain\npopular in practice due to their simplicity and predictable\nbehavior. Systems like Google’s Chubby [5] and Apache\nZooKeeper [8] provide centralized locking services that ar e\nwidely used in production environments [9].\nC. Distributed Locking Protocols\nDistributed locking protocols distribute lock management\nresponsibility across multiple nodes in the system. This ap -\nproach addresses many limitations of centralized locking b ut\nintroduces challenges of its own:\n\nQuorum-based protocols like Paxos and Raft provide strong\nconsistency guarantees by requiring agreement among a ma-\njority of nodes before granting a lock [3] [10]. These protoc ols\nare resilient to node failures but incur coordination overh ead.\nLease-based protocols grant locks for a limited time period ,\nreducing the impact of node failures but requiring careful\ntimeout management. The effectiveness of these protocols\ndepends heavily on clock synchronization across nodes [11]\n[5].\nOptimistic locking approaches assume conﬂicts are rare\nand verify this assumption before committing operations [7 ].\nThese approaches can provide excellent performance under\nlow-contention workloads but may require expensive conﬂic t\nresolution when contention is high.\nIII. S YSTEM MODEL AND METHODOLOGY\nA. System Model\nWe consider a distributed system consisting of nnodes\nthat communicate via message passing over an asynchronous\nnetwork. Each node can independently fail by crashing (fail -\nstop model) and may recover after a failure. The network may\nexperience arbitrary message delays and limited periods of\nnetwork partitioning.\nWithin this model, we evaluate locking protocols based on\nthe following characteristics:\n•Correctness: The protocol must ensure mutual exclusion,\npreventing multiple processes from holding a lock simul-\ntaneously\n•Liveness: The protocol should guarantee progress in the\npresence of node failures, avoiding deadlock and livelock\nconditions\n•Performance: Measured in terms of throughput, latency,\nand resource utilization under various workload condi-\ntions\n•Scalability: The ability to maintain performance as the\nsystem size increases\nB. Experimental Setup\nOur experimental evaluation was conducted on a testbed\nconsisting of 64 compute nodes distributed across three geo -\ngraphic regions (North America, Europe, and Asia). Each nod e\nwas equipped with 16 CPU cores, 64GB RAM, and connected\nvia a 10Gbps network. We implemented both centralized and\ndistributed locking protocols, including:\n•Centralized lock manager (CLM): A single-node imple-\nmentation handling all lock requests\n•Paxos-based distributed locking (PDL): A quorum-based\nprotocol requiring majority agreement\n•Lease-based distributed locking (LDL): A protocol grant-\ning time-limited locks with automatic expiration\n•Hierarchical locking (HL): A multi-level approach com-\nbining local and global locking strategies\nWorkloads were generated using a custom benchmark\nframework that simulates realistic application patterns w ith\nvarying degrees of contention, locality, and request rates . Eachexperiment was run for 30 minutes after a 5-minute warm-up\nperiod, with measurements collected at 10-second interval s.\nIV. P ERFORMANCE EVALUATION\nA. Throughput Analysis\nWe evaluated the throughput of different locking protocols\nunder varying levels of contention, deﬁned as the probabili ty\nthat two consecutive operations target the same resource [1 8]\n[19]. Figure 1 shows the results of this analysis.\n0 20 40 60 80 10000.20.40.60.81·105\nContention Level (%)Throughput (ops/sec)CLM\nPDL\nLDL\nHL\nFig. 1. Throughput vs. Contention Level for different locki ng protocols\nUnder low contention (0-20%), the centralized lock manager\n(CLM) demonstrates competitive performance, achieving up\nto 95,000 operations per second. This is primarily due to\nthe minimal coordination overhead when conﬂicts are rare\n[23]. However, as contention increases, CLM’s performance\ndegrades rapidly, dropping to only 18,000 operations per\nsecond under 100% contention.\nIn contrast, distributed protocols maintain higher throug hput\nunder increased contention [15] [22]. The lease-based dis-\ntributed locking (LDL) protocol demonstrates the best perf or-\nmance under high contention, maintaining 65,000 operation s\nper second even at 100% contention. This represents a 261%\nimprovement over CLM under the same conditions.\nB. Latency Analysis\nWe measured the average and 99th percentile latency for\nlock acquisition across different system scales. Table I pr esents\nthese results for a moderate contention workload (40%).\nTABLE I\nLOCK ACQUISITION LATENCY (MS)AT40% C ONTENTION\nSystem Size Average Latency 99th Percentile\n(Nodes) CLM LDL CLM LDL\n8 12.3 15.7 47.1 38.2\n16 18.7 18.3 68.5 42.6\n32 29.5 20.1 112.8 48.9\n64 48.2 22.8 187.4 53.7\nAs shown in Table I, CLM demonstrates lower average\nlatency in small-scale deployments (8 nodes) due to reduced\n\ncoordination overhead. However, as the system scales, CLM’ s\nlatency increases signiﬁcantly, with average latency grow ing\nby 292% from 8 to 64 nodes. More concerning is the tail\nlatency (99th percentile), which exceeds 187ms in large-sc ale\ndeployments [21].\nLDL shows more stable performance across different system\nscales, with average latency increasing by only 45% from 8\nto 64 nodes [20]. This stability is crucial for applications with\nstrict latency requirements, as it provides more predictab le\nperformance. The difference in tail latency is particularl y\nnotable, with LDL’s 99th percentile latency being 71% lower\nthan CLM’s at 64 nodes.\nC. Scalability Analysis\nTo evaluate scalability, we measured the maximum sustain-\nable throughput as the system size increases. Figure 2 prese nts\nthese results for a moderate contention workload (40%).\n8 16 32 6400.20.40.60.811.2·105\nSystem Size (Nodes)Maximum Throughput (ops/sec)CLM\nPDL\nLDL\nHL\nFig. 2. Maximum Throughput vs. System Size at 40% Contention\nThe centralized lock manager demonstrates poor scalabilit y,\nwith throughput decreasing by 9.7% as the system scales from\n8 to 64 nodes. This decrease occurs despite the addition of\ncomputational resources, highlighting the fundamental bo ttle-\nneck of the centralized approach [29].\nIn contrast, distributed protocols demonstrate positive s cal-\ning characteristics [ ?]. LDL shows the best scalability, with\nthroughput increasing by 29.6% as the system scales from 8\nto 64 nodes. This improvement is attributed to increased loc k\nlocality and reduced global coordination as the system size\ngrows [24].\nD. Geo-Distribution Impact\nWe evaluated the impact of geo-distribution on locking\nperformance by comparing deployments within a single regio n\nversus deployments spread across three geographic regions .\nTable II presents the average lock acquisition latency for e ach\nprotocol under these conditions.\nGeo-distribution signiﬁcantly impacts all protocols, but to\nvarying degrees. CLM exhibits the most severe performance\ndegradation, with latency increasing by 333% in multi-regi on\ndeployments [14]. This dramatic increase is primarily due t oTABLE II\nAVERAGE LOCK ACQUISITION LATENCY (MS)INSINGLE -REGION VS .\nMULTI -REGION DEPLOYMENTS\nDeployment CLM PDL LDL HL\nSingle Region 29.5 20.1 20.1 23.6\nMulti-Region 127.8 72.3 65.7 48.9\nIncrease (%) 333% 260% 227% 107%\nthe need for all nodes to communicate with a single lock\nmanager, regardless of geographic location.\nHierarchical locking (HL) demonstrates the best perfor-\nmance in geo-distributed environments, with only a 107%\nlatency increase [17]. This advantage stems from HL’s multi -\nlevel design, which prioritizes local lock acquisition whe n\npossible and only coordinates globally when necessary [16] .\nV. O PTIMIZATION STRATEGIES\nBased on our performance analysis, we propose several\noptimization strategies for distributed locking in modern en-\nvironments:\nA. Locality-Aware Lock Placement\nBy analyzing access patterns and placing locks close to\nthe nodes that most frequently access them, we can reduce\nnetwork latency and improve overall performance. Our imple -\nmentation of locality-aware lock placement resulted in a 37 %\nreduction in average lock acquisition latency in geo-distr ibuted\nenvironments.\nThe key components of this approach include:\n•Dynamic monitoring of resource access patterns\n•Periodic reassignment of lock management responsibili-\nties based on observed patterns\n•Gradual migration to avoid disruption during pattern\nchanges\nThis approach is particularly effective for workloads with\nstable access patterns, where the beneﬁts of optimized plac e-\nment outweigh the cost of migration.\nB. Adaptive Lease Duration\nTraditional lease-based protocols use ﬁxed lease duration s,\nwhich may be suboptimal under changing workload condi-\ntions. We implemented an adaptive lease duration mechanism\nthat dynamically adjusts based on observed contention and\nfailure rates.\nUnder high contention, shorter lease durations increase lo ck\nturnover and reduce waiting time. Under low contention,\nlonger lease durations reduce coordination overhead [30].\nOur experimental results show that adaptive lease duration\nimproved throughput by up to 42% compared to ﬁxed-duration\napproaches in environments with ﬂuctuating workloads.\nC. Hybrid Locking Strategies\nWe developed a hybrid locking approach that combines the\nstrengths of different protocols based on resource charact eris-\ntics:\n\n•Frequently accessed, highly contended resources use op-\ntimistic locking with efﬁcient conﬂict resolution\n•Critical resources with strict consistency requirements u se\nquorum-based protocols\n•Resources with predictable access patterns use lease-\nbased protocols with adaptive durations\nThis approach demonstrated a 28% improvement in overall\nsystem throughput compared to using any single protocol\nacross all resources. The key challenge lies in correctly cl as-\nsifying resources and managing the increased complexity of\nmultiple protocols within a single system.\nVI. C ONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK\nOur comprehensive analysis of distributed locking protoco ls\nreveals that while no single approach is optimal for all scen ar-\nios, distributed protocols signiﬁcantly outperform centr alized\napproaches in high-scale and geo-distributed environment s.\nLease-based distributed locking demonstrates the best ove rall\nperformance, particularly under high contention, while hi erar-\nchical locking excels in geo-distributed deployments.\nThe optimization strategies we proposed—locality-aware\nlock placement, adaptive lease duration, and hybrid lockin g\nstrategies—further improve performance by adapting to spe -\nciﬁc workload characteristics and deployment environment s.\nOur experimental results validate the effectiveness of the se\napproaches, showing performance improvements of up to 68%\ncompared to baseline implementations.\nFuture work will explore several promising directions:\n•Integration with software-deﬁned networking for opti-\nmized communication paths between locking components\n•Machine learning-based prediction of access patterns for\nproactive lock placement\n•Formal veriﬁcation of distributed locking protocols to\nensure correctness under complex failure scenarios\n•Exploration of specialized hardware acceleration for dis-\ntributed coordination primitives\nAs distributed systems continue to evolve, efﬁcient lockin g\nmechanisms will remain critical to ensuring both performan ce\nand correctness. By building on the insights and optimizati ons\npresented in this paper, system designers can make informed\ndecisions about locking strategies based on their speciﬁc\nrequirements and constraints.\nREFERENCES\n[1] M.
