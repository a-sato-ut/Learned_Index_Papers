ANN search algorithms can be roughly categorized into four leading index families: graph-based, tree-based,\nquantization-based, and LSH-based. Although these methods are still affected by the curse of dimensionality , their\nreduced sensitivity equips them better for searching large datasets or spaces with high intrinsic dimensionality.\nMoreover, machine learning models can be incorporated to improve the efficiency of data structures and algorithms for\nsimilaritysearchinhigh-dimensionalspaces[ 3,4]. Thisevidencesupportsourgoalofexploringhybridapproachesthat\nintegrate traditional indexing methods with machine learning techniques.\nThisproposalwouldfacilitatehandlinglarge,heterogeneousdatasetsthatmustbestoredorprocessedindistributed\nenvironments. These increasingly prevalent datasets require not only more advanced indexing mechanisms but also the\nadoption of non-conventional distance functions that more accurately capture similarity between elements. In practice,\nthis additional requirement excludes many existing exact or approximate similarity search methods, primarily designed\nfor metric spaces.\nIn addition, several studies [ 5,6,7] have recently considered the use of alternative distance measures for similarity\nsearch in spaces with diverse topologies, thereby revealing the potential impact of selecting the most suitable distance\nmeasureonthe 𝑘-NNsearchalgorithmsperformance.

Experimental results demonstrate that PDASC constitutes a reliable\nANN search method for distributed environments. Besides, it can handle datasets where selecting the most appropriate\ndistance function is non-trivial without requiring specific hardware acceleration strategies, such as GPUs or TPUs.\nThe main contributions of this paper are:\n•Introducing PDASC, a parametrizable ANN search algorithm that leverages a multilevel index that applies\nclusteringtechniquesinaninnovativeway,specificallydesignedtohandleoutliers,highlyimbalanceddatasets,\nand sparse data distributions.\n•Enabling the use of arbitrary distance measures in PDASC by integrating clustering algorithms that can\ninherently accommodate multiple distance functions into the index-building process.\n•Conductingaseriesofexperimentsonreal-worlddatasetsusingseveraldistancefunctionsthatdemonstrate\nPDASC’sreliabilityandvalidateourcorehypothesisthatselectinganappropriatedistancefunctionsignificantly\nimpacts ANN search performance.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the fundamentals of similarity search, review existing\napproaches for approximate similarity search, and discuss the impact of the chosen distance function on similarity\nqueries. Section 3 presents PDASC and highlights the motivation for integrating clustering algorithms that support\ndistance functions beyond the Euclidean metric. In Section 4, we detail the empirical experiments conducted on\nreal-worlddatasetsandpresentthecorrespondingfindings.

Finally, Section 2.3 discusses the impact of distance function selection on similarity\nsearch queries, particularly in the context of high-dimensional data.\n2.1 Similarity search\nSearching for data objects closest to a given query element based on a similarity (or conversely, dissimilarity) measure,\noftenreferredtoasadistance,isafundamentaloperationthathasbecomeincreasinglysignificantintoday’sdata-driven\nlandscape. This search paradigm, known as similarity search [ 9,10,11], is a cornerstone technique in various\ndisciplines,extensivelyappliedininformationretrieval[ 12],multimediacontent-basedsearch[ 13],machinelearning\n[14], bioinformatics [15] and cybersecurity [16].\nIn information retrieval, this technique involves a set of objects Xrepresented by feature vectors in a multidimensional\nspace and a function 𝛿:X×X↦→Rthat assigns a score 𝛿(𝑎,𝑏)to each pair of objects 𝑎,𝑏∈Xreflecting their degree\nofdissimilarityaccordingtothisfunction. Giventhatthisfunctionassignsahigherscore(oftenexpressedasadistance)\nto less similarobjects and a lower score tomore similar ones, the goalof a similarity query is to identifythe object or\nset of objects 𝑆⊆Xwith the smallest distance to a given query object 𝑞∈X.\nAs depicted in Figure 1, for a given query object 𝑞, the query result specifies a portion of the ordered dataset:\n•Rangequery : Findsallobjectsof Xwithinaspecifiedthresholdaround 𝑞. Formally,consistsonretrieving\n𝑆={𝑜𝑖|𝛿(𝑜𝑖,𝑞)≤𝑟,∀𝑜𝑖∈X}.\n•𝑘-nearest-neighbour query : Finds the set of 𝑘objects within Xthat are closest to 𝑞, that is,𝑆={𝑜𝑖∈X|\n𝛿(𝑜𝑖,𝑞)≤𝛿(𝑜𝑛,𝑞),∀𝑜𝑛∈X}. Thenearest-neighbour query is a particular case of this type, where 𝑘=1.\nFigure 1: Conceptual representation of several types of query searches.\nThe substantial computational cost associated with similarity queries arises from the need to process feature vectors and\nperform distance computations to evaluate object similarities [ 10]. While a sequential scan evaluating 𝑛distances can\nresolveanysimilarityquery,thismethodbecomesimpracticalforlargeorhigh-dimensionaldatasetsduetoitsexcessive\ncomputationalburden.

Thisstrategyreducestheneedtoexhaustivelysearchtheentiredatasetforeachquery,thereby\nreducing the number of distance computations and avoiding the high costs associated with sequential scans.\nGiven a search space ( X,𝛿) defined by a set of objects Xand a distance function 𝛿, access methods organize (or index)\nthedataset’sobjectsaccordingtothepropertiesofthesearchspaceinordertominimizethetimerequiredtoretrievethe\nqueryresults. Atquerytime, pruningstrategiesareemployedtofilteroutportionsoftheindexstructurethatcannot\ncontain valid results. When the employed distance function satisfies the properties of a metric, these methods are\nreferred to as Metric Access Methods (MAMs) [9, 11].\n2.2 Approximate similarity search approaches\nIn similarity search methods, a distinction is made between exact and approximate approaches. Exact search methods\nguarantee the retrieval of the true result set, regardless of the computational resources and time required to obtain them.\nIn contrast, approximate search methods strike a balance between accuracy and speed, offering significantly faster\nresponse times despite potential inaccuracies in the results.\n3\n\nA parametrizable algorithm for distributed approximate similarity search with arbitrary distances A Preprint\nApproximate similarity search methods are particularly effective in scenarios where exact methods cannot respond fast,\nsuchaswithhigh-dimensionalorlargedatasetswhereexactapproachesoftendefaulttoafullscan. Insteadofsearching\nfor the exact result set for a query, these approximate algorithms utilize techniques such as feature space transformation\nor space partitioning to identify a subset of candidate items that are likely to be highly similar, thereby reducing the\nnumber of distances computed. These methods can be roughly categorized into four index families: graph-based [ 17],\ntree-based [18], quantization-based [19] and LSH-based [20] [21].\nTree-basedmethodsarewidelyemployedforscalability,robustness,andefficientindexconstruction. Thesemethods\nhierarchicallypartitiondataspaces,groupingsimilarobjectsintoleafnodes. Eachnodeoftencontainsrepresentative\nobjects summarizing the partition and some information about the objects within it. During a search, the query\nobject is compared to these representatives, enabling the algorithm to efficiently exclude partitions unlikely to contain\nrelevantresults,therebyreducingoverallsearchtime. Whiletraditionalstructuressuchaskd-treesandball-treesare\nsignificantly affected by the curse of dimensionality , recent advances have led to redesigned indexes that better handle\nhigh-dimensional data. Examples include HD-Index [ 22] for optimized disk-based structures, Hercules [ 23] for parallel\nprocessing, and TARDIS [24] for distributed environments.\n2.3 Using different distance functions\nThedissimilarityvaluecapturestheclosenessbetweenapairofobjects,interpretedasadistanceinasuitablespace.\nAsthenumberofdimensionsincreases, thevolumeofthespacegrowsexponentially, andthedensityofpointsinthe\nspace decreases. This sparsity makes distances between elements tend to become more uniform, posing a challenge in\naccuratelymeasuringthesimilaritybetweendataelementssinceproximitybecomeslessmeaningful,aphenomenon\nwidely known as curse of dimensionality [2]. Consequently, elements can be very far apart, even though they are close\naccording to a distance function.\nEven if it has been demonstrated that, due to this phenomenon, it is very costly to find the exact nearest neighbour\nin high-dimensional Euclidean spaces [ 25,26], the Euclidean distance is one of the most widely used measures by\nindexing structures and search algorithms in such spaces [ 27], likely due to the conventional tendency to associate\ndistance between points with the Euclidean metric, which aligns with the intuitive notion of distance commonly applied\nin geospatial problems.\nAlthough Euclidean spaces reflect an intuitive conception of distance, it is challenging to extrapolate this natural\nassumptionwithhigh-dimensionaldata. Moreover,traditionalclusteringalgorithms,suchas 𝑘-means,oftenspecify\nthe Euclidean distance as the preferred one without considering other possibilities. This choice brings a self-imposed\nlimitation that may produce results far from the best [28, 29, 8].\nIn recent years, several studies [ 5,6,7] have addressed the use of alternative distance measures for similarity search in\nspaces with diverse topologies, thereby raising the issue of the potential impact that selecting the most suitable distance\nmeasuremayhaveontheperformanceof 𝑘-NNsearchalgorithms.

Section3.2examinesthecharacteristicsofvariousdistancefunctions.\nFinally,Section3.3highlightsthecloserelationshipbetweenEuclideandistanceandthe 𝑘-meansalgorithm,thereby\njustifying the need for alternative clustering algorithms.\n3.1 PDASC\nPDASC is a parametrizable algorithm for approximate 𝑘-NN search that leverages a multilevel index built by applying\nclustering techniques in a tailored manner. It also offers the flexibility to support arbitrary distance functions by\nintegrating compatible clustering algorithms. Its design, tailored explicitly for distributed environments, makes it\nparticularlyeffectiveathandlingoutliers,highlyimbalanceddatasets,andsparse datadistributionswithoutrequiring\nadditional hardware acceleration strategies such as GPUs or TPUs. According to the taxonomy described in Section 2.2,\nPDASC falls within the tree-based approximations.\nPDASC is implemented in Python and operates through two stages: the Multilevel Structure Algorithm (MSA) and the\nNeighbours Search Algorithm (NSA), with their pseudocode detailed in Algorithms 1 and 2, respectively.\n4\n\nA parametrizable algorithm for distributed approximate similarity search with arbitrary distances A Preprint\nAsoutlinedinAlgorithm1,MSAfollowsabottom-upapproachtoconstructamultilevelindexstructuretailoredfor\ndistributed,scalabledataindexing. Theprocessbeginsbyrandomlypartitioningthedatasetintomultiplesubsetsthat\ncan be distributed across different computational nodes. For each subset, a suitable clustering algorithm is applied\nto generate representative points (prototypes) that summarize the data within that subset. In contrast to traditional\nclusteringalgorithms,which seektogeneratetheminimalnumber ofprototypesneededfordata representation,MSA\nleveragesclusteringtechniquesfromadifferentperspective: aimingtoproduceasmanyprototypesascomputational\nresources permit. The density of the underlying data drives the distribution of prototypes: denser regions receive\na proportionally higher number of prototypes, while outliers and clusters distinct from the main concentrations are\nalso identified, This results in a richer, more detailed characterization of the underlying data points. These prototypes\nare recursively clustered layer by layer until the stop condition is met. At this point, the index structure is entirely\nconstructed.\nThe structure generated by MSA depends on several initial parameters:\n•Group length ( 𝑔𝑙).

Although the only requirement for the clustering algorithm used to\nconstruct the index is that it partitions the data space into Voronoi regions and generates a representative point\nfor each, PDASC’s ability to support multiple distance functions is achieved using clustering algorithms in the\nindex-buildingprocessthatcanacceptthem.

Only the\nprototypes satisfying 𝑑(𝑞,𝑃 3−𝑖)<𝑟(i.e.,𝑃3−1,𝑃3−4, and𝑃3−5) are considered for further exploration.\nNext, the algorithm calculates the distances between 𝑞and all points within the selected clusters and retains only\nprototypeswith distancesbelow 𝑟.

When the lowest level is reached, a set of potential candidates is\nidentified:𝑐𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑠 ={𝑝3,𝑝4,𝑝14,𝑝20,𝑝22,𝑝29}. These candidates are then sorted by their distances to 𝑞, and the\ntwo closest points ( 𝑘=2) are selected as nearest neighbours: {𝑝29,𝑝4}.\n3.2 Distance functions\nIn the context of similarity search and other application domains, the term ‘distance’ refers to a function that measures\nthedissimilaritybetweentwoobjectsinfeaturespace,satisfyingthepropertiesofnon-negativity,symmetry,andidentity\nof indiscernible. Besides, when a distance function also satisfies the triangle inequality, it qualifies as a metric [ 9]. This\nwork focuses on three specific distance functions: Minkowski distance, cosine distance and Haversine distance.\n7\n\nA parametrizable algorithm for distributed approximate similarity search with arbitrary distances A Preprint\nFigure 3: Conceptual representation of the 𝑘-NN search process in PDASC.\nMinkowski distance\nThe Minkowski distance or ℓ𝑝𝑛𝑜𝑟𝑚is a metric that generalises a set of distance measures commonly used to compute\nthe dissimilarity of objects described by numerical attributes.\nLetℓ𝑝\n∞,𝑝≥1be a vector space of real sequences such thatÍ∞\n𝑖=1|𝑥𝑖|𝑝with the norm given by ||𝑥||𝑝(Í∞\n𝑖=1|𝑥𝑖|𝑝)1\n𝑝. This\nnorm induces the ℓ𝑛𝑜𝑟𝑚or Minkowski metric 𝑑𝑝and consequently ℓ𝑚\n𝑝andℓ𝑚\n𝑝=(R𝑚,𝑑𝑝)are Banach spaces.\nThus, assuming 𝑥,𝑦∈R𝑚, theℓ𝑛𝑜𝑟𝑚or Minkowski distance is defined as follows:\n𝑑𝑝(𝑥,𝑦)=(𝑚∑︁\n𝑖=1|𝑥𝑖−𝑦𝑖|𝑝)1\n𝑝,𝑝≥1 (1)\nwhere depending on the 𝑝value we can induce:\n𝑑1(𝑥,𝑦)=Í𝑚\n𝑖=1|𝑥𝑖−𝑦𝑖|, the Manhattan or city-block distance.\n𝑑2(𝑥,𝑦)=𝑑𝐸(𝑥,𝑦)=(Í𝑚\n𝑖=1|𝑥𝑖−𝑦𝑖|2)1\n2, the Euclidean distance.\nd∞(𝑥,𝑦)=𝑑𝑚𝑎𝑥(𝑥,𝑦)=𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑖|𝑥𝑖−𝑦𝑖|, the max-norm or Chebyshev distance.\nMinkowski distances with 𝑝 <1cannot be considered proper metrics since they do not hold the triangle inequality.\nNonetheless, several authors have shown that fractional distances can significantly improve the effectiveness of standard\nclustering algorithms such as 𝑘-means [29].\nCosine distance\nThe cosine distance is a dissimilarity measure between two non-zero vectors in an inner product space which calculates\nthecosineoftheanglebetweenthem.

Thus, the cosine distance ranges from 0 to 2, where 0 means that the vectors are identical and 2 means\nthat they are diametrically opposed to each other.\nHaversine distance\nTheHaversinedistance[ 30]isadissimilaritymeasureusedtocalculatetheshortestdistancebetweentwopointson\nthesurfaceofasphere,suchastheEarth.

Objectswithin\nthe same cluster are more similar to each other than to those in different clusters.\nAmong the various clustering algorithms suitable for unsupervised learning, we found 𝑘-means [33], probably the most\nwidelyusedclusteringalgorithmofalltime. Givenasetofobjects XinEuclideanspace, 𝑘-meanspartitionsthedata\ninto𝑘non-overlapping clusters, often conceptualized as Voronoi cells, by identifying 𝑘centroids that minimize the sum\nof squared distances between each object in Xand its nearest centroid. Each centroid 𝑐𝑖represents the mean of its\nrespective cluster and may not necessarily be an element of X.\nDespiteitswidespreaduse, 𝑘-meansclusteringhasseveralwell-knownlimitations. Aprimarydrawbackistheusers’\nneed to specify the number of clusters, which can be challenging without prior knowledge of the data’s structure.\nSelectinganinappropriatenumberofclusterscanleadtoineffectivesummarizationofthedata,eitherbyoverfitting\nwithtoomanycentroidsorbyoversimplifyingwithtoofew,leadingtogroupingdissimilardatapoints. Furthermore,\nthechoiceofdistancefunctionin 𝑘-meanscansignificantlyaffectclusteringresults,asitdetermineshowsimilarity\nbetween data points is calculated, leading to clusters with different shapes and separations.\nHowever, while it might appear theoretically feasible to apply 𝑘-means with various distance functions, the algorithm’s\niterative optimization process is intrinsically linked to the Euclidean distance because the selection of prototype points\nis based on minimizing the sum of squared errors, calculated as the sum of squared Euclidean distances between each\ndata point and its assigned centroid, thus restricting the algorithm’s application to Euclidean spaces.\nAs discussed in Section 2.3, the use of Euclidean distance in high-dimensional data analysis arises from its widespread\nintegrationintoexistingindexingstructuresandalgorithms[ 27]. However,thismetrichaswell-establishedlimitationsin\nhigh-dimensional spaces, as it may not accurately capture the actual proximity between data points [ 26]. Consequently,\nthereisacompellingneedtoexplorealternativedissimilaritymeasuresforreal-worlddataindexing,thereforeemploying\nalternative clustering methods suitable for different distance functions, such as 𝑘-medoids.\n3.3.1 k-medoids\nWhilethefirstpaperproposingageneralised 𝑘-meansmethodwas[ 34],itwasKaufmannandRousseeuw[ 35]whofirst\nproposed the widely used Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM) algorithm, also known as 𝑘-medoids.

But, while\n𝑘-meansdefinesaprototypeasacentroid,whichisusuallythemeanofagroupofpoints,on 𝑘-medoidstheprototypeis\namemberofthesubset,calledamedoid. Thisdistinctionmakes 𝑘-medoidsmoreversatile,asitdoesnotrequirethe\ndissimilarity measure to strictly adhere to metric properties, allowing it to accommodate alternative distance functions.\nDespite being a widely used algorithm in data analysis, implementing 𝑘-medoids remains non-trivial. However, its\nproven efficiency and suitability have led to the development of modern implementations such as FasterPAM [ 36,37],\nanenhanced versionofPAM algorithm. Originally proposedinJava, itintroduces aspeed-up for largernumbersof\nclusters by exploiting redundancies during the swap phase of medoid computation.\nTo integrate it with PDASC, entirely developed in Python, we will employ the FasterPAM Python implementation [ 38]\navailablethroughthe 𝑘𝑚𝑒𝑑𝑜𝑖𝑑𝑠 package 2. IncorporatingthislibrarywillenablePDASCtoemploy 𝑘-medoidsasa\nclustering algorithm, thereby allowing the use of arbitrary dissimilarities and distances.\n4 Experimental evaluation\nThis section presents a comprehensive evaluation of PDASC through a series of experiments.

The results will then be\ncompared to determine PDASC’s effectiveness in ANN search.\n4.3 Performance evaluation\nA straightforward method to evaluate an algorithm’s performance is to search for the approximate 𝑘-NN of every query\npoint in a test dataset against a previously indexed train dataset.\nWeusethe recalltomeasuretheaccuracyofthealgorithm’sperformanceinthistask,therebyassessingitsabilityto\nretrieve the relevant elements during a search.

Theseitemsaretypicallyobtainedusinganexact\nsearch algorithm, with the KD-Tree ( 𝐾-Dimensional Tree)[ 41] being the preferred method due to its computational\nefficiency. However, when the KD-Tree does not support the chosen distance function, the Brute-Force method, which\naccommodates a broader range of distance functions, is employed instead.\n4.4 Algorithm comparison\nInourattempttocomparePDASCwithsimilaralgorithms,weaimedtoselectthosethat,likeourproposedmethod,\nofferuserparametrisationtoadapttospecificproblemrequirements,operateindistributedenvironments,andsupport\nanydistancefunction. However,wefound noalgorithmthatstrictlymeetsallthese criteria. Asaresult, wecompared\nthe performance of PDASC in each experiment with that of two robust and widely used algorithms. The main features\nof these algorithms, which also differ in their index construction strategies, are described below:\n•FLANN (Fast Library for Approximate Nearest Neighbors) [ 42], is an efficient tree-based method that applies\nrandom projection and hierarchical partitioning to create index structures that speed up search operations.\nUserscanmanuallyadjustparameterstofine-tunetheprocessaccordingtotheirpreferencesorusetheprovided\n12\n\nA parametrizable algorithm for distributed approximate similarity search with arbitrary distances A Preprint\nautomated approach for selecting the optimal algorithm and parameter settings for a given dataset. It also\nincludes a distributed framework, making it suitable for distributed environments. However, the range of\nsupported distance functions is quite limited. We utilized the Python bindings provided by the pyflann 7\nlibrary and employed its automated parameter setting to ensure optimal performance.\n•ThePyNNDescent(PyNN)algorithmisaPython-basedimplementationoftheNNDescentalgorithm[ 43]8\nthat efficiently performs nearest neighbour searches by building a graph-based index connecting each data\npoint to its ANN. PyNN also allows users to fine-tune parameters, optimising the trade-off between search\naccuracyandcomputationalefficiency. Itiswell-suitedforhigh-dimensionaldatasetsandsupportsvarious\ndistance functions. However, it does not natively support distributed environments.\n4.5 Experimental results\nUpon completing the experiments for each dataset-distance-method combination, we can assess the effectiveness of the\nproposed method and determine the suitability of specific distance functions for distinct datasets based on their inherent\nproperties. Theresults oftheseexperimentsare presentedinFigure 5andtheysupport oneofthemain hypothesesof\nthis research: data indexing using non-Euclidean distances is not only feasible but can also potentially yield improved\noutcomes.\nFirst, the series of experiments described in Section 4.2 were conducted using the Municipalities dataset. Figure 5a\npresentsapointplotillustratingtherecallachievedintheapproximate10 -NNsearchusingtheFLANN,PyNN,and\nPDASC methods with Manhattan, Euclidean, Chebyshev, cosine, and Haversine distance functions, respectively.\nIn this dataset, all methods achieve high recall rates with Minkowski distances, with PyNN and PDASC reaching\nnearly 100% recall. Notably, PDASC maintains this high performance with the cosine distance, whereas PyNN’s recall\nsignificantly decreases to 54%, marking the lowest recall observed for this dataset. This dataset lets us evaluate the\nHaversine distance for two-dimensional data, where both PDASC and PyNN exhibit a recall of 100%, confirming\nitseffectivenessforthistypeofdata. SinceFLANNdoesnotsupportChebyshev,cosine,orHaversinedistances,its\nperformance in these scenarios cannot be evaluated.\nThesefindingsdemonstratethatPDASC’sbottom-upindexingstrategyeffectivelyorganizesreal-worlddatasetsthat\noften exhibit complex structures and anomalies, including significant outliers.\nThe second experiment employs the MNIST dataset, which acts as an interesting case study thanks to its high\ndimensionalityandinherentsparsity. Theresultsobtainedinthis experimentarepresentedinFigure5b. Theanalysis\nreveals that the recall achieved by PyNN and PDASC are highly comparable, with PDASC consistently achieving\nslightly higher values. Both methods reach high recall values for all distances except for Chebyshev, which has a recall\nbelow70%. Additionally,theusefulnessofFLANNisquestionednotonlybyitslackofsupportforChebyshevand\ncosine distances but also by its low recall (less than 60%) for this dataset, which is more complex than the one analysed\npreviously.\nHereafter, the third experiment involves the analysis of the GLOVE dataset, a high-dimensional dataset that contains the\nlargest number of elements among the datasets included in these experiments. Figure 5c illustrates the recall achieved\nby each method across the evaluated distances.\nOnce again, the lack of efficiency is evident in FLANN ´s results since it cannot reach 15% with either Euclidean or the\nManhattandistance. If we focus onPyNNmethod andcomparethe recallforthe four distances, wecan seethatthe\nManhattandistanceprovides agoodaccuracy andthe Chebyshev distancegives theworst recall,while Euclideanand\ncosinedistancesofferasimilarperformanceofover65%. However,inthecaseofPDASC,itmaintainsaconsistent\nrecall of 100%, regardless of the distance function used.\nFinally, the last experiment replicates the same analysis using a dataset characterised by high dimensionality, featuring a\ndata-to-dimensionality ratio lower than that of GLOVE but higher than MNIST: the NYtimes dataset.\nFigure 5dillustrates the recallachievedby FLANN, PyNNand PDASC, highlighting themost striking findingof this\nexperiment: achieving good performance depends not only on the use of a suitable method but also on the choice of an\nappropriate distance function. Although PDASC consistently outperforms the other two algorithms in all scenarios, the\ntrends observed for PyNN are similar to PDASC. Both algorithms exhibit the lowest recall with the Euclidean distance,\nfollowed by the Manhattan distance, and show considerable improvement with the Chebyshev distance. The cosine\ndistance achieves the best results with PDASC, attaining a recall close to 100% and significantly overtaking PyNN,\nreaching a recall slightly above 65%. Once again, FLANN exhibits the poorest performance.\n7https://github.com/primetang/pyflann\n8https://pynndescent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n13\n\nA parametrizable algorithm for distributed approximate similarity search with arbitrary distances A Preprint\n(a)X𝑚𝑢𝑛𝑖dataset\n (b)X𝑀𝑁𝐼𝑆𝑇dataset\n(c)X𝐺𝐿𝑂𝑉𝐸dataset\n (d)X𝑁𝑌𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒𝑠dataset\nFigure5: Pointplotillustratingtherecallperformanceofthreealgorithmsacrossvariousdistancemetricsinapproximate\n10-NN searches for each dataset.\nThrough this experiment, we empirically demonstrate what has been stated theoretically in earlier sections of this\nmanuscript: defaulting to Euclidean distance in indexing structures and similarity queries is a self-imposed limitation\nthat can result in suboptimal performance.\n5 Conclusions and future work\nANNsearchisanessentialtechniqueinscenarioswhereexactapproachescannotprovidefastresponses,particularly\nwhendealingwithlarge,heterogeneousdatasetsthatoftenexhibithighdimensionalityandhighsparsityorareimpractical\nto process or store on a single machine.\nAlthoughithasbeendemonstratedthat,duetothe curseofdimensionality ,theEuclideandistancemaynotaccurately\ncapture the true proximity between data points in high-dimensional spaces, it remains one of the most widely used\nmeasuresinindexingstructuresandsearchalgorithms[ 27],highlightingtheneedtoexplorealternativedistancemetrics\nthat more effectively address these challenges.\nTo address this gap, we propose PDASC, a parametrizable algorithm for approximate 𝑘-NN search that combines\nan innovative multilevel index particularly adept at managing outliers, highly imbalanced datasets, and sparse data\n14\n\nA parametrizable algorithm for distributed approximate similarity search with arbitrary distances A Preprint\ndistributionswiththeflexibilitytosupportarbitrarydistancefunctionsachievedthroughtheintegrationofclustering\nalgorithms that inherently accommodate them.\nExperimental evaluation on real-world datasets varying in type, size, dimensionality, and sparsity, shows that PDASC,\nparametrisedwiththe 𝑘-medoidsclusteringalgorithm,consistentlyoutperformsalternativeindexingmethodsforall\ndistance functions considered in our study (see Section 4.5 for details).\nThese results validate PDASC as a reliable ANN search method, suitable for use in distributed data environments\nand handling datasets where selecting the most appropriate distance function is non-trivial, all without the need for\nadditionalhardwareaccelerationstrategiessuchasGPUsorTPUs.
