To accurately capture tail queries and data points, learned\nrepresentations typically are rigid, high-dimensional vectors that are generally\nused as-is in the entire ANNS pipeline and can lead to computationally expensive\nretrieval. In this paper, we argue that instead of rigid representations, different\nstages of ANNS can leverage adaptive representations of varying capacities to\nachieve significantly better accuracy-compute trade-offs, i.e., stages of ANNS that\ncan get away with more approximate computation should use a lower-capacity\nrepresentation of the same data point. To this end, we introduce AdANNS\n ,\na novel ANNS design framework that explicitly leverages the flexibility of Ma-\ntryoshka Representations [ 31]. We demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy-compute\ntrade-offs using novel AdANNS -based key ANNS building blocks like search\ndata structures ( AdANNS -IVF) and quantization ( AdANNS -OPQ). For exam-\nple on ImageNet retrieval, AdANNS -IVF is up to 1.5%more accurate than the\nrigid representations-based IVF [ 48] at the same compute budget; and matches\naccuracy while being up to 90×faster in wall-clock time . For Natural Questions,\n32-byte AdANNS -OPQ matches the accuracy of the 64-byte OPQ baseline [ 13]\nconstructed using rigid representations – same accuracy at half the cost! We further\nshow that the gains from AdANNS translate to modern-day composite ANNS\nindices that combine search structures and quantization. Finally, we demonstrate\nthatAdANNS can enable inference-time adaptivity for compute-aware search\non ANNS indices built non-adaptively on matryoshka representations.

In its simplest form, semantic search methods learn a neural network to embed\nqueries as well as a large number ( N) of data points in a d-dimensional vector space. For a given query,\nthe nearest (in embedding space) point is retrieved using either an exact search or using approximate\nnearest neighbor search (ANNS) [21] which is now indispensable for real-time large-scale retrieval.\nExisting semantic search methods learn fixed or rigid representations ( RRs) which are used as is\nin all the stages of ANNS (data structures for data pruning and quantization for cheaper distance\ncomputation; see Section 2). That is, while ANNS indices allow a variety of parameters for searching\nthe design space to optimize the accuracy-compute trade-off, the provided data dimensionality is\ntypically assumed to be an immutable parameter. To make it concrete, let us consider inverted file\nindex (IVF) [ 48], a popular web-scale ANNS technique [ 16]. IVF has two stages (Section 3) during\ninference: (a) cluster mapping : mapping the query to a cluster of data points [ 36], and (b) linear\n∗Equal contribution.\n37th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2023).arXiv:2305.19435v2  [cs.LG]  18 Oct 2023\n\n/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000013/uni00000018 /uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000018 /uni00000014 /uni00000014/uni00000013\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\n/uni00000061/uni00000014/uni00000011/uni00000018/uni00000008/uni00000003/uni0000004a/uni00000044/uni0000004c/uni00000051/uni00000061/uni0000001c/uni00000013×/uni00000003/uni00000055/uni00000048/uni00000044/uni0000004f/uni00000010/uni0000005a/uni00000052/uni00000055/uni0000004f/uni00000047/uni00000003/uni00000056/uni00000053/uni00000048/uni00000048/uni00000047/uni00000010/uni00000058/uni00000053\n/uni00000024/uni00000047/uni00000024/uni00000031/uni00000031/uni00000036/uni00000010/uni0000002c/uni00000039/uni00000029\n/uni00000035/uni0000004c/uni0000004a/uni0000004c/uni00000047/uni00000010/uni0000002c/uni00000039/uni00000029(a) Image retrieval on ImageNet-1K.\n/uni00000016/uni00000015 /uni00000017/uni0000001b /uni00000019/uni00000017 /uni0000001c/uni00000019\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\n/uni00000061/uni00000016/uni00000008/uni00000003/uni0000004a/uni00000044/uni0000004c/uni00000051\n/uni00000015×/uni00000003/uni00000046/uni0000004b/uni00000048/uni00000044/uni00000053/uni00000048/uni00000055\n/uni00000024/uni00000047/uni00000024/uni00000031/uni00000031/uni00000036/uni00000010/uni00000032/uni00000033/uni00000034\n/uni00000035/uni0000004c/uni0000004a/uni0000004c/uni00000047/uni00000010/uni00000032/uni00000033/uni00000034 (b) Passage retrieval on Natural Questions.\nFigure 1: AdANNS helps design search data structures and quantization methods with better\naccuracy-compute trade-offs than the existing solutions. In particular, (a) AdANNS -IVF improves on\nstandard IVF by up to 1.5%in accuracy while being 90×faster in deployment and (b) AdANNS -OPQ\nis as accurate as the baseline at half the cost! Rigid-IVF and Rigid-OPQ are standard techniques that\nare built on rigid representations ( RRs ) while AdANNS uses matryoshka representations ( MRs ) [31].\nscan: distance computation w.r.t all points in the retrieved cluster to find the nearest neighbor (NN).\nStandard IVF utilizes the same high-dimensional RRfor both phases, which can be sub-optimal.\nWhy the sub-optimality? Imagine one needs to partition a dataset into kclusters for IVF and the\ndimensionality of the data is d– IVF uses full drepresentation to partition into kclusters. However,\nsuppose we have an alternate approach that somehow projects the data in d/2dimensions and learns\n2kclusters. Note that the storage and computation to find the nearest cluster remains the same in both\ncases, i.e., when we have kclusters of ddimensions or 2kclusters of d/2dimensions. 2kclusters\ncan provide significantly more refined partitioning, but the distances computed between queries and\nclusters could be significantly more inaccurate after projection to d/2dimensions.\nSo, if we can find a mechanism to obtain a d/2-dimensional representation of points that can accurately\napproximate the topology/distances of d-dimensional representation, then we can potentially build\nsignificantly better ANNS structure that utilizes different capacity representations for the cluster\nmapping and linear scan phases of IVF. But how do we find such adaptive representations ? These\ndesired adaptive representations should be cheap to obtain and still ensure distance preservation\nacross dimensionality. Post-hoc dimensionality reduction techniques like SVD [ 14] and random\nprojections [ 25] on high-dimensional RRs are potential candidates, but our experiments indicate that\nin practice they are highly inaccurate and do not preserve distances well enough (Figure 2).\nInstead, we identify that the recently proposed Matryoshka Representations ( MRs ) [31] satisfy\nthe specifications for adaptive representations. Matryoshka representations pack information in a\nhierarchical nested manner, i.e., the first m-dimensions of the d-dimensional MR form an accurate\nlow-dimensional representation while being aware of the information in the higher dimensions.\nThis allows us to deploy MRs in two major and novel ways as part of ANNS: (a) low-dimensional\nrepresentations for accuracy-compute optimal clustering and quantization, and (b) high-dimensional\nrepresentations for precise re-ranking when feasible.\nTo this effort, we introduce AdANNS\n , a novel design framework for semantic search that uses\nmatryoshka representation-based adaptive representations across different stages of ANNS to ensure\nsignificantly better accuracy-compute trade-off than the state-of-the-art baselines.\nTypical ANNS systems have two key components: (a) search data structure to store datapoints, (b)\ndistance computation to map a given query to points in the data structure. Through AdANNS , we\naddress both these components and significantly improve their performance. In particular, we first\npropose AdANNS -IVF (Section 4.1) which tackles the first component of ANNS systems. AdANNS -\nIVF uses standard full-precision computations but uses adaptive representations for different IVF\nstages. On ImageNet 1-NN image retrieval (Figure 1a), AdANNS -IVF is up to 1.5%more accurate\nfor the compute budget and 90×cheaper in deployment for the same accuracy as IVF.\n2\n\nWe then propose AdANNS -OPQ (Section 4.2) which addresses the second component by using\nAdANNS -based quantization (OPQ [ 13]) – here we use exhaustive search overall points. AdANNS -\nOPQ is as accurate as the baseline OPQ on RRs while being at least 2×faster on Natural Ques-\ntions [ 32] 1-NN passage retrieval (Figure 1b). Finally, we combine the two techniques to obtain\nAdANNS -IVFOPQ (Section 4.3) which is more accurate while being much cheaper – up to 8×\n– than the traditional IVFOPQ [ 24] index. To demonstrate generality of our technique, we adapt\nAdANNS to DiskANN [22] which provides interesting accuracy-compute tradeoff; see Table 1.\nWhile MR already has multi-granular representations, careful integration with ANNS building blocks\nis critical to obtain a practical method and is our main contribution . In fact, Kusupati et al. [31]\nproposed a simple adaptive retrieval setup that uses smaller-dimensional MR for shortlisting in re-\ntrieval followed by precise re-ranking with a higher-dimensional MR. Such techniques, unfortunately,\ncannot be scaled to industrial systems as they require forming a new index for every shortlisting\nprovided by low-dimensional MR. Ensuring that the method aligns well with the modern-day\nANNS pipelines is important as they already have mechanisms to handle real-world constraints like\nload-balancing [ 16] and random access from disk [ 22]. So, AdANNS is a step towards making the\nabstraction of adaptive search and retrieval feasible at the web-scale.\nThrough extensive experimentation, we also show that AdANNS generalizes across search data\nstructures, distance approximations, modalities (text & image), and encoders (CNNs & Transformers)\nwhile still translating the theoretical gains to latency reductions in deployment. While we have mainly\nfocused on IVF and OPQ-based ANNS in this work, AdANNS also blends well with other ANNS\npipelines. We also show that AdANNS can enable compute-aware elastic search on prebuilt indices\nwithout making any modifications (Section 5.1); note that this is in contrast to AdANNS -IVF that\nbuilds the index explicitly utilizing “adaptivity” in representations. Finally, we provide an extensive\nanalysis on the alignment of matryoshka representation for better semantic search (Section 5.2).\nWe make the following key contributions:\n•We introduce AdANNS\n , a novel framework for semantic search that leverages matryoshka\nrepresentations for designing ANNS systems with better accuracy-compute trade-offs.\n•AdANNS powered search data structure ( AdANNS -IVF) and quantization ( AdANNS -OPQ) show\na significant improvement in accuracy-compute tradeoff compared to existing solutions.\n•AdANNS generalizes to modern-day composite ANNS indices and can also enable compute-aware\nelastic search during inference with no modifications.\n2 Related Work\nApproximate nearest neighbour search (ANNS) is a paradigm to come as close as possible [ 7] to\nretrieving the “true” nearest neighbor (NN) without the exorbitant search costs associated with\nexhaustive search [ 21,52]. The “approximate” nature comes from data pruning as well as the cheaper\ndistance computation that enable real-time web-scale search. In its naive form, NN-search has a\ncomplexity of O(dN);dis the data dimensionality used for distance computation and Nis the size\nof the database. ANNS employs each of these approximations to reduce the linear dependence on the\ndimensionality (cheaper distance computation) and data points visited during search (data pruning).\nCheaper distance computation. From a bird’s eye view, cheaper distance computation is always\nobtained through dimensionality reduction (quantization included). PCA and SVD [ 14,26] can\nreduce dimensionality and preserve distances only to a limited extent without sacrificing accuracy.\nOn the other hand, quantization-based techniques [ 6,15] like (optimized) product quantization\n((O)PQ) [ 13,23] have proved extremely crucial for relatively accurate yet cheap distance computation\nand simultaneously reduce the memory overhead significantly. Another naive solution is to indepen-\ndently train the representation function with varying low-dimensional information bottlenecks [ 31]\nwhich is rarely used due to the costs of maintaining multiple models and databases.\nData pruning. Enabled by various data structures, data pruning reduces the number of data points\nvisited as part of the search. This is often achieved through hashing [ 8,46], trees [ 3,12,16,48]\nand graphs [ 22,38]. More recently there have been efforts towards end-to-end learning of the\nsearch data structures [ 17,29,30]. However, web-scale ANNS indices are often constructed on rigid\nd-dimensional real vectors using the aforementioned data structures that assist with the real-time\nsearch. For a more comprehensive review of ANNS structures please refer to [5, 34, 51].\n3\n\nComposite indices. ANNS pipelines often benefit from the complementary nature of various building\nblocks [ 24,42]. In practice, often the data structures (coarse-quantizer) like IVF [ 48] and HNSW [ 37]\nare combined with cheaper distance alternatives like PQ [ 23] (fine-quantizer) for massive speed-ups\nin web-scale search. While the data structures are built on d-dimensional real vectors, past works\nconsistently show that PQ can be safely used for distance computation during search time. As\nevident in modern web-scale ANNS systems like DiskANN [ 22], the data structures are built on\nd-dimensional real vectors but work with PQ vectors ( 32−64-byte) for fast distance computations.\nANNS benchmark datasets. Despite the Herculean advances in representation learning [ 19,42],\nANNS progress is often only benchmarked on fixed representation vectors provided for about a\ndozen million to billion scale datasets [ 1,47] with limited access to the raw data. This resulted in\nthe improvement of algorithmic design for rigid representations ( RRs) that are often not specifically\ndesigned for search. All the existing ANNS methods work with the assumption of using the provided\nd-dimensional representation which might not be Pareto-optimal for the accuracy-compute trade-\noff in the first place. Note that the lack of raw-image and text-based benchmarks led us to using\nImageNet-1K [ 45] (1.3M images, 50K queries) and Natural Questions [ 32] (21M passages, 3.6K\nqueries) for experimentation. While not billion-scale, the results observed on ImageNet often translate\nto real-world progress [ 28], and Natural Questions is one of the largest question answering datasets\nbenchmarked for dense passage retrieval [ 27], making our results generalizable and widely applicable.\nIn this paper, we investigate the utility of adaptive representations – embeddings of different dimen-\nsionalities having similar semantic information – in improving the design of ANNS algorithms. This\nhelps in transitioning out of restricted construction and inference on rigid representations for ANNS.\nTo this end, we extensively use Matryoshka Representations ( MRs ) [31] which have desired adaptive\nproperties in-built. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that improves accuracy-compute\ntrade-off in ANNS by leveraging adaptive representations on different phases of construction and\ninference for ANNS data structures.\n3 Problem Setup, Notation, and Preliminaries\nThe problem setup of approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) [ 21] consists of a database of N\ndata points, [x1, x2, . . . , x N], and a query, q, where the goal is to “approximately” retrieve the nearest\ndata point to the query. Both the database and query are embedded to Rdusing a representation\nfunction ϕ:X →Rd, often a neural network that can be learned through various representation\nlearning paradigms [2, 19, 20, 40, 42].\nMatryoshka Representations ( MRs ).Thed-dimensional representations from ϕcan have a nested\nstructure like Matryoshka Representations ( MRs ) [31] in-built – ϕMR(d). Matryoshka Representation\nLearning (MRL) learns these nested representations with a simple strategy of optimizing the same\ntraining objective at varying dimensionalities. These granularities are ordered such that the lowest\nrepresentation size forms a prefix for the higher-dimensional representations. So, high-dimensional\nMR inherently contains low-dimensional representations of varying granularities that can be accessed\nfor free – first m-dimensions ( m∈[d]) ie., ϕMR(d)[1 :m]from the d-dimensional MR form an\nm-dimensional representation which is as accurate as its independently trained rigid representation\n(RR) counterpart – ϕRR(m). Training an encoder with MRL does not involve any overhead or\nhyperparameter tuning and works seamlessly across modalities, training objectives, and architectures.\nInverted File Index (IVF). IVF [ 48] is an ANNS data structure used in web-scale search sys-\ntems [ 16] owing to its simplicity, minimal compute overhead, and high accuracy. IVF construction\ninvolves clustering (coarse quantization through k-means) [ 36] ond-dimensional representation that\nresults in an inverted file list [ 53] of all the data points in each cluster. During search, d-dimensional\nquery representation is assigned to the most relevant cluster ( Ci;i∈[k]) by finding the closest cen-\ntroid ( µi) using an appropriate distance metric ( L2or cosine). This is followed by an exhaustive linear\nsearch across all data points in the cluster which gives the closest NN (see Figure 5 in Appendix A\nfor IVF overview). Lastly, IVF can scale to web-scale by utilizing a hierarchical IVF structure within\neach cluster [ 16]. Table 2 in Appendix A describes the retrieval formula for multiple variants of IVF.\nOptimized Product Quantization (OPQ). Product Quantization (PQ) [ 23] works by splitting a\nd-dimensional real vector into msub-vectors and quantizing each sub-vector with an independent 2b\n4\n\nlength codebook across the database. After PQ, each d-dimensional vector can be represented by a\ncompact m×bbit vector; we make each vector mbytes long by fixing b= 8. During search time,\ndistance computation between the query vector and PQ database is extremely efficient with only m\ncodebook lookups. The generality of PQ encompasses scalar/vector quantization [ 15,36] as special\ncases. However, PQ can be further improved by rotating the d-dimensional space appropriately to\nmaximize distance preservation after PQ. Optimized Product Quantization (OPQ) [ 13] achieves this\nby learning an orthonormal projection matrix Rthat rotates the d-dimensional space to be more\namenable to PQ. OPQ shows consistent gains over PQ across a variety of ANNS tasks and has\nbecome the default choice in standard composite indices [22, 24].\nDatasets. We evaluate the ANNS algorithms while changing the representations used for the search\nthus making it impossible to evaluate on the usual benchmarks [ 1]. Hence we experiment with two\npublic datasets: (a) ImageNet-1K [ 45] dataset on the task of image retrieval – where the goal is to\nretrieve images from a database (1.3M image train set) belonging to the same class as the query\nimage (50K image validation set) and (b) Natural Questions (NQ) [ 32] dataset on the task of question\nanswering through dense passage retrieval – where the goal is to retrieve the relevant passage from a\ndatabase (21M Wikipedia passages) for a query (3.6K questions).\nMetrics Performance of ANNS is often measured using recall score [ 22],k-recall@ N– recall of\nthe exact NN across search complexities which denotes the recall of k“true” NN when Ndata points\nare retrieved. However, the presence of labels allows us to compute 1-NN (top-1) accuracy. Top-1\naccuracy is a harder and more fine-grained metric that correlates well with typical retrieval metrics\nlike recall and mean average precision (mAP@ k). Even though we report top-1 accuracy by default\nduring experimentation, we discuss other metrics in Appendix C. Finally, we measure the compute\noverhead of ANNS using MFLOPS/query and also provide wall-clock times (see Appendix B.1).\nEncoders. For ImageNet, we encode both the database and query set using a ResNet50 ( ϕI) [19]\ntrained on ImageNet-1K. For NQ, we encode both the passages in the database and the questions in\nthe query set using a BERT-Base ( ϕN) [10] model fine-tuned on NQ for dense passage retrieval [ 27].\nWe use the trained ResNet50 models with varying representation sizes ( d= [8,16, . . . , 2048] ; default\nbeing 2048 ) as suggested by Kusupati et al. [31] alongside the MRL-ResNet50 models trained with\nMRL for the same dimensionalities. The RRandMR models are trained to ensure the supervised\none-vs-all classification accuracy across all data dimensionalities is nearly the same – 1-NN accuracy\nof2048 -dRRandMR models are 71.19% and70.97% respectively on ImageNet-1K. Independently\ntrained models, ϕRR(d)\nI , output d= [8,16. . . ,2048] dimensional RRs while a single MRL-ResNet50\nmodel, ϕMR(d)\nI , outputs a d= 2048 -dimensional MR that contains all the 9 granularities.\nWe also train BERT-Base models in a similar vein as the aforementioned ResNet50 models. The\nkey difference is that we take a pre-trained BERT-Base model and fine-tune on NQ as suggested\nby Karpukhin et al. [27] with varying (5) representation sizes (bottlenecks) ( d= [48 ,96, . . . , 768];\ndefault being 768) to obtain ϕRR(d)\nN that creates RRs for the NQ dataset. To get the MRL-BERT-\nBase model, we fine-tune a pre-trained BERT-Base encoder on the NQ train dataset using the MRL\nobjective with the same granularities as RRs to obtain ϕMR(d)\nN which contains all five granularities.\nAkin to ResNet50 models, the RRandMR BERT-Base models on NQ are built to have similar 1-NN\naccuracy for 768-dof52.2%and51.5%respectively. More implementation details can be found in\nAppendix B and additional experiment-specific information is provided at the appropriate places.\n4AdANNS – Adaptive ANNS\nIn this section, we present our proposed AdANNS\n framework that exploits the inherent flexibility\nof matryoshka representations to improve the accuracy-compute trade-off for semantic search com-\nponents. Standard ANNS pipeline can be split into two key components: (a) search data structure\nthat indexes and stores data points, (b) query-point computation method that outputs (approximate)\ndistance between a given query and data point. For example, standard IVFOPQ [ 24] method uses\nan IVF structure to index points on full-precision vectors and then relies on OPQ for more efficient\ndistance computation between the query and the data points during the linear scan.\n5\n\nBelow, we show that AdANNS can be applied to both the above-mentioned ANNS components\nand provides significant gains on the computation-accuracy tradeoff curve. In particular, we present\nAdANNS -IVF which is AdANNS version of the standard IVF index structure [ 48], and the closely\nrelated ScaNN structure [ 16]. We also present AdANNS -OPQ which introduces representation adap-\ntivity in the OPQ, an industry-default quantization. Then, in Section 4.3 we further demonstrate the\ncombination of the two techniques to get AdANNS -IVFOPQ – an AdANNS version of IVFOPQ [ 24]\n– and AdANNS -DiskANN, a similar variant of DiskANN [ 22]. Overall, our experiments show that\nAdANNS -IVF is significantly more accuracy-compute optimal compared to the IVF indices built on\nRRs andAdANNS -OPQ is as accurate as the OPQ on RRs while being significantly cheaper.\n4.1 AdANNS -IVF\n/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000014 /uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000018 /uni00000014 /uni00000018\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\n/uni00000024/uni00000047/uni00000024/uni00000031/uni00000031/uni00000036/uni00000010/uni0000002c/uni00000039/uni00000029\n/uni00000024/uni00000047/uni00000024/uni00000031/uni00000031/uni00000036/uni00000010/uni0000002c/uni00000039/uni00000029/uni00000010/uni00000027\n/uni00000030/uni0000002a/uni00000010/uni0000002c/uni00000039/uni00000029/uni00000010/uni00000035/uni00000035\n/uni00000030/uni0000002a/uni00000010/uni0000002c/uni00000039/uni00000029/uni00000010/uni00000036/uni00000039/uni00000027\n/uni0000002c/uni00000039/uni00000029/uni00000010/uni00000030/uni00000035\n/uni0000002c/uni00000039/uni00000029/uni00000010/uni00000035/uni00000035\nFigure 2: 1-NN accuracy on ImageNet retrieval shows\nthatAdANNS -IVF achieves near-optimal accuracy-compute\ntrade-off compared across various rigid and adaptive base-\nlines. Both adaptive variants of MR andRRsignificantly\noutperform their rigid counterparts (IVF-XX) while post-hoc\ncompression on RRusing SVD for adaptivity falls short.Recall from Section 1 that IVF has\na clustering and a linear scan phase,\nwhere both phase use same dimen-\nsional rigid representation. Now,\nAdANNS -IVF allows the clustering\nphase to use the first dcdimensions\nof the given matryoshka represen-\ntation ( MR). Similarly, the linear\nscan within each cluster uses dsdi-\nmensions, where again dsrepresents\ntopdscoordinates from MR. Note\nthat setting dc=dsresults in non-\nadaptive regular IVF. Intuitively, we\nwould set dc≪ds, so that instead\nof clustering with a high-dimensional\nrepresentation, we can approximate it\naccurately with a low-dimensional em-\nbedding of size dcfollowed by a lin-\near scan with a higher ds-dimensional\nrepresentation. Intuitively, this helps\nin the smooth search of design space\nfor state-of-the-art accuracy-compute\ntrade-off. Furthermore, this can provide a precise operating point on accuracy-compute tradeoff curve\nwhich is critical in several practical settings.\nOur experiments on regular IVF with MRs andRRs (IVF- MR & IVF- RR) of varying dimensionali-\nties and IVF configurations (# clusters, # probes) show that (Figure 2) matryoshka representations\nresult in a significantly better accuracy-compute trade-off. We further studied and found that learned\nlower-dimensional representations offer better accuracy-compute trade-offs for IVF than higher-\ndimensional embeddings (see Appendix E for more results).\nAdANNS utilizes d-dimensional matryoshka representation to get accurate dcanddsdimensional\nvectors at no extra compute cost. The resulting AdANNS -IVF provides a much better accuracy-\ncompute trade-off (Figure 2) on ImageNet-1K retrieval compared to IVF- MR, IVF- RR, and MG-\nIVF-RR –multi-granular IVF with rigid representations (akin to AdANNS without MR) – a strong\nbaseline that uses dcanddsdimensional RRs. Finally, we exhaustively search the design space of\nIVF by varying dc, ds∈[8,16, . . . , 2048] and the number of clusters k∈[8,16, . . . , 2048] . Please\nsee Appendix E for more details. For IVF experiments on the NQ dataset, please refer to Appendix G.\nEmpirical results. Figure 2 shows that AdANNS -IVF outperforms the baselines across all\naccuracy-compute settings for ImageNet-1K retrieval. AdANNS -IVF results in 10×lower compute\nfor the best accuracy of the extremely expensive MG-IVF- RRand non-adaptive IVF- MR. Specifi-\ncally, as shown in Figure 1a, AdANNS -IVF is up to 1.5%more accurate for the same compute and\nhas up to 100×lesser FLOPS/query ( 90×real-world speed-up!) than the status quo ANNS on rigid\nrepresentations (IVF- RR). We filter out points for the sake of presentation and encourage the reader\nto check out Figure 8 in Appendix E for an expansive plot of all the configurations searched.\nThe advantage of AdANNS for construction of search structures is evident from the improvements\nin IVF ( AdANNS -IVF) and can be easily extended to other ANNS structures like ScaNN [ 16] and\n6\n\nHNSW [ 38]. For example, HNSW consists of multiple layers with graphs of NSW graphs [ 37] of\nincreasing complexity. AdANNS can be adopted to HNSW, where the construction of each level can\nbe powered by appropriate dimensionalities for an optimal accuracy-compute trade-off. In general,\nAdANNS provides fine-grained control over compute overhead (storage, working memory, inference,\nand construction cost) during construction and inference while providing the best possible accuracy.\n4.2 AdANNS -OPQ\nStandard Product Quantization (PQ) essentially performs block-wise vector quantization via cluster-\ning. For example, suppose we need 32-byte PQ compressed vectors from the given 2048 dimensional\nrepresentations. Then, we can chunk the representations in m= 32 equal blocks/sub-vectors of 64-d\neach, and each sub-vector space is clustered into 28= 256 partitions. That is, the representation of\neach point is essentially cluster-id for each block. Optimized PQ (OPQ) [ 13] further refines this idea,\nby first rotating the representations using a learned orthogonal matrix, and then applying PQ on top\nof the rotated representations. In ANNS, OPQ is used extensively to compress vectors and improves\napproximate distance computation primarily due to significantly lower memory overhead than storing\nfull-precision data points IVF.\nAdANNS -OPQ utilizes MR representations to apply OPQ on lower-dimensional representations.\nThat is, for a given quantization budget, AdANNS allows using top ds≪ddimensions from MR and\nthen computing clusters with ds/m-dimensional blocks where mis the number of blocks. Depending\nondsandm, we have further flexibility of trading-off dimensionality/capacity for increasing the\nnumber of clusters to meet the given quantization budget. AdANNS -OPQ tries multiple ds,m, and\nnumber of clusters for a fixed quantization budget to obtain the best performing configuration.\nWe experimented with 8−128byte OPQ budgets for both ImageNet and Natural Questions retrieval\nwith an exhaustive search on the quantized vectors. We compare AdANNS -OPQ which uses MRs of\nvarying granularities to the baseline OPQ built on the highest dimensional RRs. We also evaluate\nOPQ vectors obtained projection using SVD [14] on top of the highest-dimensional RRs.\nEmpirical results. Figures 3 and 1b show that AdANNS -OPQ significantly outperforms – up to\n4%accuracy gain – the baselines (OPQ on RRs ) across compute budgets on both ImageNet and NQ.\nIn particular, AdANNS -OPQ tends to match the accuracy of a 64-byte (a typical choice in ANNS)\nOPQ baseline with only a 32-byte budget. This results in a 2×reduction in both storage and compute\nFLOPS which translates to significant gains in real-world web-scale deployment (see Appendix D).\nWe only report the best AdANNS -OPQ for each budget typically obtained through a much lower-\ndimensional MR (128&192; much faster to build as well) than the highest-dimensional MR (2048\n&768) for ImageNet and NQ respectively (see Appendix G for more details). At the same time, we\n/uni00000014/uni00000019 /uni00000016/uni00000015 /uni00000019/uni00000017\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\n/uni00000024/uni00000047/uni00000024/uni00000031/uni00000031/uni00000036/uni00000010/uni00000032/uni00000033/uni00000034\n/uni00000032/uni00000033/uni00000034/uni00000010/uni00000035/uni00000035\n/uni00000032/uni00000033/uni00000034/uni00000010/uni00000035/uni00000035/uni00000010/uni00000036/uni00000039/uni00000027\nFigure 3: AdANNS -OPQ matches the accuracy\nof64-byte OPQ on RRusing only 32-bytes for\nImageNet retrieval.

On ImageNet retrieval, AdANNS -\nIVFOPQ is 8 ×cheaper for the same accuracy\nand provides 1-4%gains over IVFOPQ on RRs .\n7\n\nnote that building compressed OPQ vectors on projected RRs using SVD to the smaller dimensions\n(or using low-dimensional RRs, see Appendix D) as the optimal AdANNS -OPQ does not help in\nimproving the accuracy. The significant gains we observe in AdANNS -OPQ are purely due to better\ninformation packing in MRs –we hypothesize that packing the most important information in the\ninitial coordinates results in a better PQ quantization than RRs where the information is uniformly\ndistributed across all the dimensions [31, 49]. See Appendix D for more details and experiments.\n4.3 AdANNS for Composite Indices\nWe now extend AdANNS to composite indices [ 24] which put together two main ANNS building\nblocks – search structures and quantization – together to obtain efficient web-scale ANNS indices\nused in practice. A simple instantiation of a composite index would be the combination of IVF and\nOPQ – IVFOPQ – where the clustering in IVF happens with full-precision real vectors but the linear\nscan within each cluster is approximated using OPQ-compressed variants of the representation –\nsince often the full-precision vectors of the database cannot fit in RAM. Contemporary ANNS indices\nlike DiskANN [ 22] make this a default choice where they build the search graph with a full-precision\nvector and approximate the distance computations during search with an OPQ-compressed vector to\nobtain a very small shortlist of retrieved datapoints. In DiskANN, the shortlist of data points is then\nre-ranked to form the final list using their full-precision vectors fetched from the disk. AdANNS is\nnaturally suited to this shortlist-rerank framework: we use a low- dMR for forming index, where we\ncould tune AdANNS parameters according to the accuracy-compute trade-off of the graph and OPQ\nvectors. We then use a high- dMR for re-ranking.\nTable 1: AdANNS -DiskANN using a 16-dMR + re-ranking\nwith the 2048 -dMR outperforms DiskANN built on 2048 -d\nRRathalf the compute cost on ImageNet retrieval.\nRR-2048 AdANNS\nPQ Budget (Bytes) 32 16\nTop-1 Accuracy (%) 70.37 70.56\nmAP@10 (%) 62.46 64.70\nPrecision@40 (%) 65.65 68.25Empirical results. Figure 4 shows\nthatAdANNS -IVFOPQ is 1−4%\nbetter than the baseline at all the\nPQ compute budgets. Furthermore,\nAdANNS -IVFOPQ has the same ac-\ncuracy as the baselines at 8×lower\noverhead. With DiskANN, AdANNS\naccelerates shortlist generation by us-\ning low-dimensional representations\nand recoups the accuracy by re-\nranking with the highest-dimensional\nMR at negligible cost. Table 1 shows that AdANNS -DiskANN is more accurate than the baseline for\nboth 1-NN and ranking performance at only half the cost. Using low-dimensional representations\nfurther speeds up inference in AdANNS -DiskANN (see Appendix F).\nThese results show the generality of AdANNS and its broad applicability across a variety of ANNS\nindices built on top of the base building blocks. Currently, AdANNS piggybacks on typical ANNS\npipelines for their inherent accounting of the real-world system constraints [ 16,22,25]. However,\nwe believe that AdANNS ’s flexibility and significantly better accuracy-compute trade-off can be\nfurther informed by real-world deployment constraints. We leave this high-potential line of work that\nrequires extensive study to future research.\n5 Further Analysis and Discussion\n5.1 Compute-aware Elastic Search During Inference\nAdANNS search structures cater to many specific large-scale use scenarios that need to satisfy precise\nresource constraints during construction as well as inference. However, in many cases, construction\nand storage of the indices are not the bottlenecks or the user is unable to search the design space.\nIn these settings, AdANNS -D enables adaptive inference through accurate yet cheaper distance\ncomputation using the low-dimensional prefix of matryoshka representation. Akin to composite\nindices (Section 4.3) that use PQ vectors for cheaper distance computation, we can use the low-\ndimensional MR for faster distance computation on ANNS structure built non-adaptively with a\nhigh-dimensional MR without any modifications to the existing index.\nEmpirical results. Figure 2 shows that for a given compute budget using IVF on ImageNet-1K\nretrieval, AdANNS -IVF is better than AdANNS -IVF-D due to the explicit control during the building\n8\n\nof the ANNS structure which is expected. However, the interesting observation is that AdANNS -D\nmatches or outperforms the IVF indices built with MRs of varying capacities for ImageNet retrieval.\nHowever, these methods are applicable in specific scenarios of deployment. Obtaining optimal\nAdANNS search structure (highly accurate) or even the best IVF-MR index relies on a relatively\nexpensive design search but delivers indices that fit the storage, memory, compute, and accuracy\nconstraints all at once. On the other hand AdANNS -D does not require a precisely built ANNS index\nbut can enable compute-aware search during inference. AdANNS -D is a great choice for setups that\ncan afford only one single database/index but need to cater to varying deployment constraints, e.g.,\none task requires 70% accuracy while another task has a compute budget of 1 MFLOPS/query.\n5.2 Why MRs over RRs?\nQuite a few of the gains from AdANNS are owing to the quality and capabilities of matryoshka\nrepresentations. So, we conducted extensive analysis to understand why matryoshka representations\nseem to be more aligned for semantic search than the status-quo rigid representations.\nDifficulty of NN search. Relative contrast ( Cr) [18] is inversely proportional to the difficulty of\nnearest neighbor search on a given database. On ImageNet-1K, Figure 14 shows that MRs have\nbetter CrthanRRs across dimensionalities, further supporting that matryoshka representations are\nmore aligned (easier) for NN search than existing rigid representations for the same accuracy. More\ndetails and analysis about this experiment can be found in Appendix H.2.\nClustering distributions. We also investigate the potential deviation in clustering distributions\nforMRs across dimensionalities compared to RRs. Unlike the RRs where the information is\nuniformly diffused across dimensions [ 49],MRs have hierarchical information packing. Figure 11 in\nAppendix E.3 shows that matryoshka representations result in clusters similar (measured by total\nvariation distance [33]) to that of rigid representations and do not result in any unusual artifacts.\nRobustness. Figure 9 in Appendix E shows that MRs continue to be better than RRs even for out-of-\ndistribution (OOD) image queries (ImageNetV2 [ 44]) using ANNS. It also shows that the highest\ndata dimensionality need not always be the most robust which is further supported by the higher\nrecall using lower dimensions. Further details about this experiment can be found in Appendix E.1.\nGenerality across encoders. IVF-MR consistently has higher accuracy than IVF- RRacross dimen-\nsionalities despite having similar accuracies with exact NN search (for ResNet50 on ImageNet and\nBERT-Base on NQ). We find that our observations on better alignment of MRs for NN search hold\nacross neural network architectures, ResNet18/34/101 [ 19] and ConvNeXt-Tiny [ 35]. Appendix H.3\ndelves deep into the experimentation done using various neural architectures on ImageNet-1K.\nRecall score analysis. Analysis of recall score (see Appendix C) in Appendix H.1 shows that for\na similar top-1 accuracy, lower-dimensional representations have better 1-Recall@1 across search\ncomplexities for IVF and HNSW on ImageNet-1K. Across the board, MRs have higher recall scores\nand top-1 accuracy pointing to easier “searchability” and thus suitability of matryoshka representations\nfor ANNS. Larger-scale experiments and further analysis can be found in Appendix H.\nThrough these analyses, we argue that matryoshka representations are better suited for semantic\nsearch than rigid representations, thus making them an ideal choice for AdANNS .\n5.3 Search for AdANNS Hyperparameters\nChoosing the optimal hyperparameters for AdANNS, such as dc,ds,m, # clusters, # probes, is an\ninteresting and open problem that requires more rigorous examination. As the ANNS index is formed\nonce and used for potentially billions of queries with massive implications for cost, latency and\nqueries-per-second, a hyperparameter search for the best index is generally an acceptable industry\npractice [ 22,38]. The Faiss library [ 24] provides guidelines2to choose the appropriate index for a\nspecific problem, including memory constraints, database size, and the need for exact results. There\nhave been efforts at automating the search for optimal indexing parameters, such as Autofaiss3, which\nmaximizes recall given compute constraints.\n2https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss/wiki/Guidelines-to-choose-an-index\n3https://github.com/criteo/autofaiss\n9\n\nIn case of AdANNS , we suggest starting at the best configurations of MRs followed by a local\ndesign space search to lead to near-optimal AdANNS configurations (e.g. use IVF-MR to bootstrap\nAdANNS -IVF). We also share some observations during the course of our experiments:\n1.AdANNS -IVF: Top-1 accuracy generally improves (with diminishing returns after a point) with\nincreasing dimensionality of clustering ( dc) and search ( ds), as we show on ImageNet variants and\nwith multiple encoders in the Appendix (Figures 9 and 15). Clustering with low- dMRs matches\nthe performance of high- dMRs as they likely contain similar amounts of useful information,\nmaking the increased compute cost not worth the marginal gains. Increasing # probes naturally\nboosts performance (Appendix, Figure 10a). Lastly, it is generally accepted that a good starting\npoint for the # clusters kisp\nND/2, where NDis the number of indexable items [ 39].k=√ND\nis the optimal choice of kfrom a FLOPS computation perspective as can be seen in Appendix B.1.\n2.AdANNS -OPQ: we observe that for a fixed compute budget in bytes ( m), the top-1 accuracy\nreaches a peak at d < d max (Appendix, Table 4). We hypothesize that the better performance of\nAdANNS -OPQ at d < d max is due to the curse of dimensionality, i.e. it is easier to learn PQ\ncodebooks on smaller embeddings with similar amounts of information. We find that using an\nMR withd= 4×mis a good starting point on ImageNet and NQ. We also suggest using an 8-bit\n(256-length) codebook for OPQ as the default for each of the sub-block quantizer.\n3.AdANNS -DiskANN: Our observations with DiskANN are consistent with other indexing struc-\ntures, i.e. the optimal graph construction dimensionality d < d max (Appendix, Figure 12). A\ncareful study of DiskANN on different datasets is required for more general guidelines to choose\ngraph construction and OPQ dimensionality d.\n5.4 Limitations\nAdANNS ’s core focus is to improve the design of the existing ANNS pipelines. To use AdANNS\non a corpus, we need to back-fill [ 43] the MRs of the data – a significant yet a one-time overhead.\nWe also notice that high-dimensional MRs start to degrade in performance when optimizing also for\nan extremely low-dimensional granularity (e.g., <24-d for NQ) – otherwise is it quite easy to have\ncomparable accuracies with both RRs andMRs . Lastly, the existing dense representations can only\nin theory be converted to MRs with an auto-encoder-style non-linear transformation. We believe\nmost of these limitations form excellent future work to improve AdANNS further.\n6 Conclusions\nWe proposed a novel framework, AdANNS\n , that leverages adaptive representations for different\nphases of ANNS pipelines to improve the accuracy-compute tradeoff. AdANNS utilizes the inherent\nflexibility of matryoshka representations [ 31] to design better ANNS building blocks than the standard\nones which use the rigid representation in each phase. AdANNS achieves SOTA accuracy-compute\ntrade-off for the two main ANNS building blocks: search data structures ( AdANNS -IVF) and\nquantization ( AdANNS -OPQ). The combination of AdANNS -based building blocks leads to the\nconstruction of better real-world composite ANNS indices – with as much as 8×reduction in cost at\nthe same accuracy as strong baselines – while also enabling compute-aware elastic search. Finally, we\nnote that combining AdANNS with elastic encoders [ 11] enables truly adaptive large-scale retrieval.\nAcknowledgments\nWe are grateful to Kaifeng Chen, Venkata Sailesh Sanampudi, Sanjiv Kumar, Harsha Vardhan\nSimhadri, Gantavya Bhatt, Matthijs Douze and Matthew Wallingford for helpful discussions and\nfeedback.

AdANNS was implemented from scratch (Algorithm 1) due to difficulty in\ndecoupling clustering and linear scan with Faiss, with code available at https://github.com/\nRAIVNLab/AdANNS . We also provide a version of AdANNS with Faiss optimizations with the\nrestriction that Dc≥Dsas a limitation of the current implementation, which can be further optimized.\nAll ANNS experiments ( AdANNS -IVF, MG-IVF- RR, IVF- MR, IVF- RR, HNSW, HNSWOPQ,\nIVFOPQ) were run on an Intel Xeon 2.20GHz CPU with 12 cores. Exact Search (Flat L2, PQ, OPQ)\nand DiskANN experiments were run with CUDA 11.0 on a A100-SXM4 NVIDIA GPU with 40G\nRAM. The wall-clock inference times quoted in Figure 1a and Table 3 are reported on CPU with\nFaiss optimizations, and are averaged over three inference runs for ImageNet-1K retrieval.\nTable 3: Comparison of AdANNS -IVF and Rigid-IVF wall-clock inference times for ImageNet-1K\nretrieval. AdANNS -IVF has up to ∼1.5%gain over Rigid-IVF for a fixed search latency per query.\nAdANNS-IVF Rigid-IVF\nTop-1 Search Latency/Query (ms) Top-1 Search Latency/Query (ms)\n70.02 0.03 68.51 0.02\n70.08 0.06 68.54 0.05\n70.19 0.06 68.74 0.08\n70.36 0.88 69.20 0.86\n70.60 5.57 70.13 5.67\nDPR [ 27] on NQ [ 32].We follow the setup on the DPR repo4: the Wikipedia corpus has 21 million\npassages and Natural Questions dataset for open-domain QA settings. The training set contains\n79,168 question and answer pairs, the dev set has 8,757 pairs and the test set has 3,610 pairs.\nB.1 Inference Compute Cost\nWe evaluate inference compute costs for IVF in MegaFLOPS per query (MFLOPS/query) as shown\nin Figures 2, 10a, and 8 as follows:\nC=dsk+npdsND\nk\nwhere dcis the cluster construction embedding dimensionality, dsis the embedding dim used for\nlinear scan within each probed cluster, which is controlled by # of search probes np. Finally, k\nis the number of clusters |Ci|indexed over database of size ND. The default setting in this work,\nunless otherwise stated, is np= 1,k= 1024 ,ND= 1281167 (ImageNet-1K trainset). Vanilla IVF\nsupports only dc=ds, while AdANNS -IVF provides flexibility via decoupling clustering and search\n(Section 4). AdANNS -IVF-D is a special case of AdANNS -IVF with the flexibility restricted to\ninference, i.e., dcis a fixed high-dimensional MR.\n4https://github.com/facebookresearch/DPR\n15\n\nC Evaluation Metrics\nIn this work, we primarily use top-1 accuracy (i.e. 1-Nearest Neighbor), recall@k, corrected mean\naverage precision (mAP@k) [30] and k-Recall@N (recall score), which are defined over all queries\nQover indexed database of size NDas:\ntop-1 =P\nQcorrect_pred @1\n|Q|\nRecall@k =P\nQcorrect_pred @k\n|Q|∗num_classes\n|ND|\nwhere correct_pred @kis the number of k-NN with correctly predicted labels for a given query. As\nnoted in Section 3, k-Recall@N is the overlap between kexact search nearest neighbors (considered\nas ground truth) and the top N retrieved documents. As Faiss [ 24] supports a maximum of 2048-\nNN while searching the indexed database, we report 40-Recall@2048 in Figure 13. Also note\nthat for ImageNet-1K, which constitutes a bulk of the experimentation in this work, |Q|= 50000 ,\n|ND|= 1281167 and num_classes = 1000 . For ImageNetv2 [ 44],|Q|= 10000 and num_classes\n= 1000 , and for ImageNet-4K [ 31],|Q|= 210100 ,|ND|= 4202000 and num_classes = 4202 . For\nNQ [ 32],|Q|= 3610 and|ND|= 21015324 . As NQ consists of question-answer pairs (instance-\nlevel), num_classes = 3610 for the test set.\n/uni0000001b /uni00000014/uni00000019 /uni00000016/uni00000015

HNSW + OPQ on ImageNet-1K\nFigure 6: Top-1 Accuracy of AdANNS composite indices with OPQ distance computation compared\ntoMR and Rigid baselines models on ImageNet-1K and Natural Questions.\n16\n\nDAdANNS -OPQ\nIn this section, we take a deeper dive into the quantization characteristics of MR. In this work, we\nrestrict our focus to optimized product quantization (OPQ) [ 13], which adds a learned space rotation\nand dimensionality permutation to PQ’s sub-vector quantization to learn more optimal PQ codes. We\ncompare OPQ to vanilla PQ on ImageNet in Table 4, and observe large gains at larger embedding\ndimensionalities, which agrees with the findings of Jayaram Subramanya et al. [22].\nWe perform a study of composite OPQ m×bindices on ImageNet-1K across compression compute\nbudgets m(where b= 8, i.e. 1Byte), i.e. Exact Search with OPQ, IVF+OPQ, HNSW+OPQ, and\nDiskANN+OPQ, as seen in Figure 6. It is evident from these results:\n1.Learning OPQ codebooks with AdANNS (Figure 6a) provides a 1-5% gain in top-1 accuracy\nover rigid representations at low compute budgets ( ≤32Bytes). AdANNS -OPQ saturates to\nRigid-OPQ performance at low compression ( ≥64Bytes).\n2.For IVF, learning clusters with MRs instead of RRs (Figure 6b) provides substantial gains (1-\n4%). In contrast to Exact-OPQ, using AdANNS for learning OPQ codebooks does not provide\nsubstantial top-1 accuracy gains over MR withd= 2048 (highest), though it is still slightly better\nor equal to MR-2048 at all compute budgets. This further supports that IVF performance generally\nscales with embedding dimensionality, which is consistent with our findings on ImageNet across\nrobustness variants and encoders (See Figures 9 and 15 respectively).\n3.Note that in contrast to Exact, IVF, and HNSW coarse quantizers, DiskANN inherently re-ranks\nthe retrieved shortlist with high-precision embeddings ( d= 2048 ), which is reflected in its high\ntop-1 accuracy. We find that AdANNS with8-byte OPQ (Figure 6c) matches the top-1 accuracy\nof rigid representations using 32-byte OPQ, for a 4×cost reduction for the same accuracy. Also\nnote that using AdANNS provides large gains over using MR-2048 at high compression (1.5%),\nhighlighting the necessity of AdANNS ’s flexibility for high-precision retrieval at low compute\nbudgets.\n4.Our findings on the HNSW-OPQ composite index (Figure 6d) are consistent with all other indices,\ni.e. HNSW graphs constructed with AdANNS OPQ codebooks provide significant gains over RR\nandMR, especially at high compression ( ≤32Bytes).\nOPQ on NQ dataset\n/uni0000001b /uni00000014/uni00000019 /uni00000016/uni00000015 /uni00000017/uni0000001b /uni00000019/uni00000017 /uni0000001c/uni00000019\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\n/uni00000024/uni00000047/uni00000024/uni00000031/uni00000031/uni00000036/uni00000010/uni00000032/uni00000033/uni00000034\n/uni00000032/uni00000033/uni00000034/uni00000010/uni00000030/uni00000035/uni00000010/uni0000001a/uni00000019/uni0000001b\n/uni00000035/uni0000004c/uni0000004a/uni0000004c/uni00000047/uni00000010/uni00000032/uni00000033/uni00000034\n(a) Exact Search + OPQ on Natural Questions\n/uni0000001b /uni00000014/uni00000019 /uni00000016/uni00000015 /uni00000017/uni0000001b /uni00000019/uni00000017 /uni0000001c/uni00000019\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\n/uni00000024/uni00000047/uni00000024/uni00000031/uni00000031/uni00000036/uni00000010/uni0000002c/uni00000039/uni00000029/uni0000000e/uni00000032/uni00000033/uni00000034\n/uni0000002c/uni00000039/uni00000029/uni0000000e/uni00000032/uni00000033/uni00000034/uni00000010/uni00000030/uni00000035/uni00000010/uni0000001a/uni00000019/uni0000001b\n/uni00000035/uni0000004c/uni0000004a/uni0000004c/uni00000047/uni00000010/uni0000002c/uni00000039/uni00000029/uni0000000e/uni00000032/uni00000033/uni00000034 (b) IVF + OPQ on Natural Questions\nFigure 7: Top-1 Accuracy of AdANNS composite indices with OPQ distance computation compared\ntoMR and Rigid baselines models on Natural Questions.\nOur observations on ImageNet with ResNet-50 MR across search structures also extend to the Natural\nQuestions dataset with Dense Passage Retriever (DPR with BERT-Base MR embeddings).

IVF construction involves clustering (coarse quantization often through k-means) [ 36]\nond-dimensional representation that results in an inverted file list [ 53] of all the data points in each\ncluster. During search, the d-dimensional query representation is first assigned to the closest clusters\n(# probes, typically set to 1) and then an exhaustive linear scan happens within each cluster to obtain\nthe nearest neighbors. As seen in Figure 9, IVF top-1 accuracy scales logarithmically with increasing\nrepresentation dimensionality don ImageNet-1K/V2/4K. The learned low- drepresentations thus\nprovide better accuracy-compute trade-offs compared to high- drepresentations, thus furthering the\ncase for usage of AdANNS with IVF.\nOur proposed adaptive variant of IVF, AdANNS -IVF, decouples the clustering, with dcdimensions,\nand the linear scan within each cluster, with dsdimensions – setting dc=dsresults in non-\nadaptive vanilla IVF. This helps in the smooth search of design space for the optimal accuracy-\ncompute trade-off. A naive instantiation yet strong baseline would be to use explicitly trained\n18\n\n/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000014 /uni00000014 /uni00000014/uni00000013 /uni00000014/uni00000013/uni00000013\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\n/uni00000024/uni00000047/uni00000024/uni00000031/uni00000031/uni00000036/uni00000010/uni0000002c/uni00000039/uni00000029\n/uni00000024/uni00000047/uni00000024/uni00000031/uni00000031/uni00000036/uni00000010/uni0000002c/uni00000039/uni00000029/uni00000010/uni00000027\n/uni00000030/uni0000002a/uni00000010/uni0000002c/uni00000039/uni00000029/uni00000010/uni00000035/uni00000035\n/uni00000030/uni0000002a/uni00000010/uni0000002c/uni00000039/uni00000029/uni00000010/uni00000036/uni00000039/uni00000027\n/uni0000002c/uni00000039/uni00000029/uni00000010/uni00000030/uni00000035\n/uni0000002c/uni00000039/uni00000029/uni00000010/uni00000035/uni00000035Figure 8: Top-1 accuracy vs. compute cost per query of AdANNS -IVF compared to IVF- MR,\nIVF-RRand MG-IVF- RRbaselines on ImageNet-1K.\ndcanddsdimensional rigid representations (called MG-IVF- RR, for multi-granular IVF with\nrigid representations).

MRs were able\nto saturate to near-perfect 1-Recall@N for d≥32andN≥4, indicating the potential of AdANNS\nat matching exact search performance with less than 10 search probes np.\nE.3 Clustering Distribution\nWe examined the distribution of learnt clusters across embedding dimensionalities dfor both MR\nandRRmodels, as seen in Figure 11. We observe IVF- MR to have less variance than IVF- RRat\nd∈ {8,16}, and slightly higher variance for d≥32, while IVF- MR outperforms IVF- RRin top-1\nacross all d(Figure 9a). This indicates that although MR learns clusters that are less uniformly\ndistributed than RRat high d, the quality of learnt clustering is superior to RRacross all d. Note that a\nuniform distribution is N/k data points per cluster, i.e. ∼1250 for ImageNet-1K with k= 1024 .

We observe a monotonically decreasing dTV,2048\nwith increasing d, which demonstrates that MR clustering distributions get closer to RR-2048 as we\nincrease the embedding dimensionality d. We observe in Figure 11 that dTV(MR -d,RR-d)∼7e−4\nford∈ {8,256, . . . , 2048}and∼3e−4ford∈ {16,32,64}.

DiskANN builds a greedy best-first graph with OPQ distance computation, with compressed\nvectors stored in memory. The index and full-precision vectors are stored on the SSD.

Note that this does\nnot use any re-ranking after obtaining OPQ based shortlist.As with IVF, DiskANN is also well\nsuited to the flexibility provided by\nAdANNS as we demonstrate on both\nImageNet and NQ that the optimal\nPQ codebook for a given compute\nbudget is learnt with a smaller em-\nbedding dimensionality d(see Fig-\nures 6c and 7a). We demonstrate\nthe capability of AdANNS -DiskANN\nwith a compute budget of m∈\n{32,64}in Table 1. We tabulate\nthe search time latency of AdANNS -\nDiskANN in microseconds ( µs) in\nTable 6, which grows linearly with\ngraph construction dimensionality d.\nWe also examine DiskANN- MR with\nSSD graph indices on ImageNet-1K\nacross OPQ budgets for distance com-\nputation mdc∈ {32,48,64}, as seen\nin Figure 12. With SSD indices,\nwe store PQ-compressed vectors on\ndisk with mdisk =mdc, which es-\nsentially disables DiskANN’s implicit\nhigh-precision re-ranking. We ob-\nserve similar trends to other composite ANNS indices on ImageNet, where the optimal dim for\nfixed OPQ budget is not the highest dim ( d= 1024 with fp32 embeddings is current highest dim\nsupported by DiskANN which stores vectors in 4KB sectors on disk). This provides further motiva-\ntion for AdANNS -DiskANN, which leverages MRs to provide flexible access to the optimal dim\nfor quantization and thus enables similar Top-1 accuracy to Rigid DiskANN for up to 1/4the cost\n(Figure 6c).\nGAdANNS on Natural Questions\nIn addition to image retrieval on ImageNet, we also experiment with dense passage retrieval (DPR) on\nNatural Questions. As shown in Figure 6, MR representations are 1−10% more accurate than their\n5https://github.com/microsoft/DiskANN\n22\n\nRRcounterparts across PQ compute budgets with Exact Search + OPQ on NQ. We also demonstrate\nthat IVF- MR is1−2.5%better than IVF- RRfor Precision@ k,k∈ {1,5,20,100,200}. Note that\non NQ, IVF loses ∼10% accuracy compared to exact search, even with the RR-768 baseline. We\nhypothesize the weak performance of IVF owing to poor clusterability of the BERT-Base embeddings\nfine-tuned on the NQ dataset. A more thorough exploration of AdANNS -IVF on NQ is an immediate\nfuture work and is in progress.\nH Ablations\nH.1 Recall Score Analysis\n/uni00000014 /uni00000015 /uni00000017

[18].\nIn this section we also examine the variation of k-Recall@N with by probing a larger search space\nwith IVF and HNSW indices. For IVF, search probes represent the number of clusters shortlisted for\nlinear scan during inference. For HNSW, search quality is controlled by the efSearch parameter [ 38],\nwhich represents the closest neighbors to query qat level lcof the graph and is analogous to number\nof search probes in IVF. As seen in Figure 13, general trends show a) an intuitive increase in recall\nwith increasing search probes np) for fixed search probes, b) a decrease in recall with increasing\nsearch dimensionality dc) similar trends in ImageNet-1K and 4×larger ImageNet-4K.\nH.2 Relative Contrast\nWe utilize Relative Contrast [ 18] to capture the difficulty of nearest neighbors search with IVF- MR\ncompared to IVF- RR. For a given database X={xi∈Rd, i= 1, . . . , N D}, a query q∈Rd, and a\ndistance metric D(., .)we compute relative contrast Cras a measure of the difficulty in finding the\n1-nearest neighbor (1-NN) for a query qin database Xas follows:\n1. Compute Dq\nmin= min\ni=1...nD(q, xi), i.e. the distance of query qto its nearest neighbor xq\nnn∈X\n2.Compute Dq\nmean =Ex[D(q, x)]as the average distance of query qfrom all database points\nx∈X\n3.Relative Contrast of a given query Cq\nr=Dq\nmean\nDq\nmin, which is a measure of how separable the\nquery’s nearest neighbor xq\nnnis from an average point in the database x\n4. Compute an expectation over all queries for Relative Contrast over the entire database as\nCr=Eq[Dq\nmean ]\nEq[Dq\nmin]\nIt is evident that Crcaptures the difficulty of Nearest Neighbor Search in database X, as a Cr∼1\nindicates that for an average query, its nearest neighbor is almost equidistant from a random point in\nthe database. As demonstrated in Figure 14, MRs have higher RcthanRREmbeddings for an Exact\nSearch on ImageNet-1K for all d≥16. This result implies that a portion of MR’s improvement\noverRRfor 1-NN retrieval across all embedding dimensionalities d[31] is due to a higher average\nseparability of the MR 1-NN from a random database point.\nH.3 Generality across Encoders\nWe perform an ablation over the representation function ϕ:X→Rdlearnt via a backbone neural\nnetwork (primarily ResNet50 in this work), as detailed in Section 3. We also train MRL models [ 31]\nϕMR(d)on ResNet18/34/101 [ 19] that are as accurate as their independently trained RRbaseline\nmodels ϕRR(d), where dis the default max representation size of each architecture. We also train\n24\n\nMRL with a ConvNeXt-Tiny backbone with [d] ={48,96,192,384,786}.MR-768has a top-1\naccuracy of 79.45% compared to independently trained publicly available RR-768baseline with\ntop-1 accuracy 82.1%(Code and RRmodel available on the official repo6). We note that this training\nhad no hyperparameter tuning whatsoever, and this gap can be closed with additional model training\neffort. We then compare clustering the MRs via IVF- MR withk= 2048 , np= 1on ImageNet-1K to\nExact- MR, which is shown in Figure 15. IVF- MR shows similar trends across backbones compared\nto Exact- MR, i.e. a maximum top-1 accuracy drop of ∼1.6%for a single search probe. This suggests\nthe clustering capabilities of MR extend beyond an inductive bias of ϕMR(d)∈ResNet50, though\nwe leave a detailed exploration for future work.\n/uni0000001b/uni00000014/uni00000019 /uni00000016/uni00000015 /uni00000019/uni00000017/uni00000014/uni00000015/uni0000001b /uni00000015/uni00000018/uni00000019 /uni00000018/uni00000014/uni00000015/uni00000014/uni00000013/uni00000015/uni00000017 /uni00000015/uni00000013/uni00000017/uni0000001b\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\n/uni0000002c/uni00000039/uni00000029/uni00000010/uni00000030/uni00000035\n/uni00000028/uni0000005b/uni00000044/uni00000046/uni00000057/uni00000010/uni00000030/uni00000035/uni00000035/uni00000048/uni00000056/uni00000031/uni00000048/uni00000057/uni00000014/uni0000001b\n/uni00000035/uni00000048/uni00000056/uni00000031/uni00000048/uni00000057/uni00000016/uni00000015\n/uni00000035/uni00000048/uni00000056/uni00000031/uni00000048/uni00000057/uni00000018/uni00000013\n/uni00000035/uni00000048/uni00000056/uni00000031/uni00000048/uni00000057/uni00000014/uni00000013/uni00000014\n/uni00000026/uni00000052/uni00000051/uni00000059/uni00000031/uni00000048/uni0000003b/uni00000057/uni00000010/uni00000037/uni0000004c/uni00000051/uni0000005c\nFigure 15: Top-1 Accuracy variation of IVF- MR on ImageNet-1K with different embedding rep-\nresentation function ϕMR(d)(see Section 3), where ϕ∈{ResNet18/34/101, ConvNeXt-Tiny}.
