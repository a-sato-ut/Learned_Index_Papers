  "abstract": "The purpose of the Strategic Workshop in Information Retrieval in Lorne is to explore the long-range issues of the Information Retrieval field, to recognize challenges that are on - or even over - the horizon, to build consensus on some of the key challenges, and to disseminate the resulting information to the research community.
