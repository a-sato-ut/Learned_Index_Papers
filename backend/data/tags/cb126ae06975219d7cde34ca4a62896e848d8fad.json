  "abstract": "\n \n \nMachine Learning (ML) is transforming the world with research breakthroughs that are leading to the progress of every field. We are living in an era of data explosion. This further improves the output as data that can be fed to the models is more than it has ever been. Therefore, prediction algorithms are now capable of solving many of the complex problems that we face by leveraging the power of data. The models are capable of correlating a dataset and its features with an accuracy that humans fail to achieve. Bearing this in mind, this research takes an in-depth look into the of the problem- solving potential of ML in the area of Database Management Systems (DBMS). Although ML hallmarks significant scientific milestones, the field is still in its infancy. The limitations of ML models are also studied in this paper. \n \n \n",
