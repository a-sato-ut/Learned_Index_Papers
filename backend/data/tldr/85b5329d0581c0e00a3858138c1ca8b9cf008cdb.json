  "title": "Flexible Operator Embeddings via Deep Learning",
  "abstract": "Integrating machine learning into the internals of database management systems requires significant feature engineering, a human effort-intensive process to determine the best way to represent the pieces of information that are relevant to a task. In addition to being labor intensive, the process of hand-engineering features must generally be repeated for each data management task, and may make assumptions about the underlying database that are not universally true. We introduce flexible operator embeddings, a deep learning technique for automatically transforming query operators into feature vectors that are useful for a multiple data management tasks and is custom-tailored to the underlying database. Our approach works by taking advantage of an operator's context, resulting in a neural network that quickly transforms sparse representations of query operators into dense, information-rich feature vectors. Experimentally, we show that our flexible operator embeddings perform well across a number of data management tasks, using both synthetic and real-world datasets.",
  "tldr": "This paper presents flexible operator embeddings, a deep learning method that automates the transformation of query operators into feature vectors tailored for various data management tasks. This approach reduces manual feature engineering and adapts to different databases, showing strong performance in experiments."
