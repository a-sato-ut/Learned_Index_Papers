  "title": "The three pillars of machine programming",
  "abstract": "In this position paper, we describe our vision of the future of machine programming through a categorical examination of three pillars of research. Those pillars are: (i) intention, (ii) invention, and (iii) adaptation. Intention emphasizes advancements in the human-to-computer and computer-to-machine-learning interfaces. Invention emphasizes the creation or refinement of algorithms or core hardware and software building blocks through machine learning (ML). Adaptation emphasizes advances in the use of ML-based constructs to autonomously evolve software.",
  "tldr": "This paper outlines a vision for the future of machine programming, focusing on three key pillars: intention (enhancing human-computer interfaces), invention (developing algorithms and systems via machine learning), and adaptation (enabling software to autonomously evolve using ML)."
