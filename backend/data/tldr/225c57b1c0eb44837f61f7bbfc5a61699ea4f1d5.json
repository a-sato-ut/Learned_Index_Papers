  "title": "Why Are Learned Indexes So Effective but Sometimes Ineffective?",
  "abstract": "\n Learned indexes have attracted significant research interest due to their potential to offer better space-time trade-offs compared to B+-tree variants. Among various learned indexes, the PGM-Index based on error-bounded piecewise linear approximation is an elegant data structure that has demonstrated\n provably\n superior performance over conventional B+-tree indexes. However, despite numerous efforts to optimize the design of the PGM-Index, few systematically study the root causes of performance mismatches observed in practice. In this paper, we explore two key research questions.\n Q1\n :\n Why are PGM-Indexes theoretically effective?\n and\n Q2\n :\n Why do PGM-Indexes underperform in practice?\n For\n Q1\n , we show that for a set of\n N\n sorted keys, the PGM-Index can achieve a lookup time of\n O\n (log log\n N\n ) while using\n O\n (\n N\n ) space. For\n Q2\n , we identify that querying PGM-Indexes is highly memory-bound, where the internal index search operations often become the bottleneck. To fill the performance gap, we propose PGM++, a\n simple yet effective\n extension to the original PGM-Index that employs a mixture of different search strategies, with hyper-parameters automatically tuned through a cost model calibrated by theoretical findings. Extensive experiments show that, at comparable space costs, PGM++ speeds up index lookup queries by up to 2.31X and 1.56X when compared to the original PGM-Index and SOTA baselines.\n",
  "tldr": "Learned indexes, particularly the PGM-Index, offer superior theoretical performance but often underperform in practice due to memory-bound query operations. This paper introduces PGM++, an enhanced version that optimizes search strategies, achieving up to 2.31X faster lookups compared to the original PGM-Index."
