  "abstract": "We provide a simple method for improving the performance of the recently introduced learned Bloom filters, by showing that they perform better when the learned function is sandwiched between two Bloom filters.",
  "tldr": "This paper presents a method to enhance learned Bloom filters' performance by sandwiching the learned function between two traditional Bloom filters, resulting in improved efficiency and effectiveness in data retrieval tasks."
