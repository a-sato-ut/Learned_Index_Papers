  "title": "LeaderKV: Improving Read Performance of KV Stores via Learned Index and Decoupled KV Table",
  "abstract": "Log-structured merge-tree (LSM-tree) is a storage architecture widely used in key-value (KV) stores. To enhance the read efficiency of LSM-tree, recent works utilize the learned index to learn the mapping between keys and locations. However, in existing learned-index-aided KV stores, inefficient design of the learned index and disk access significantly impact the read performance. How to design a learned KV store to improve index efficiency and minimize disk access remains a critical problem. This paper presents LeaderKV, a read-optimized LSM-tree-based KV store. LeaderKV employs decoupled KV tables (DK-Table) and efficient learned indexes for data retrieval. DKTables are storage files in Leader Kvbecause they avoid reading irrelevant data in collaboration with learned indexes during queries. A learned index called Leader is proposed to accelerate data retrieval within DKTable. Leader is composed of precise models and approximate models. A redirect mechanism is designed to reduce the cost of mispredictions in Leader. We integrate DKTable and Leader into LeaderKV and demonstrate its effectiveness using a variety of datasets and workloads. Experimental results show that LeaderKV significantly improves the read performance compared to representative schemes.",
