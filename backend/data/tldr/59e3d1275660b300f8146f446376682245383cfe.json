  "title": "GoldFinger: Fast & Approximate Jaccard for Efficient KNN Graph Constructions",
  "abstract": "We propose <italic>GoldFinger</italic>, a new <italic>compact</italic> and <italic>fast-to-compute</italic> binary representation of datasets to approximate Jaccard's index. We illustrate the effectiveness of GoldFinger on the emblematic big data problem of K-Nearest-Neighbor (KNN) graph construction and show that GoldFinger can drastically accelerate a large range of existing KNN algorithms with little to no overhead. As a side effect, we also show that the compact representation of the data protects users’ privacy <italic>for free</italic> by providing <italic>k</italic>-anonymity and <italic>l</italic>-diversity. Our extensive evaluation of the resulting approach on several realistic datasets shows that our approach reduces computation times by up to 78.9% compared to raw data while only incurring a negligible to moderate loss in terms of KNN quality. We also show that GoldFinger can be applied to KNN queries (a widely-used search technique) and delivers speedups of up to <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\times 3.55$</tex-math><alternatives><mml:math><mml:mrow><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:mn>3</mml:mn><mml:mo>.</mml:mo><mml:mn>55</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math><inline-graphic xlink:href=\"ruas-ieq1-3232689.gif\"/></alternatives></inline-formula> over one of the most efficient approaches to this problem.",
  "tldr": "GoldFinger is a new binary representation method that approximates Jaccard's index, significantly speeding up KNN graph construction by up to 78.9% with minimal quality loss. It also enhances user privacy by ensuring k-anonymity and l-diversity, making it efficient for KNN queries."
