  "title": "\"Learned\"",
  "abstract": "With operating systems being at the core of computer systems, decades of research and engineering efforts have been put into the development of OSes. To keep pace with the speed of modern hardware and application evolvement, we argue that a different approach should be taken in future OS development. Instead of relying solely on human wisdom, we should also leverage AI and machine learning techniques to automatically \"learn\" how to build and tune an OS. This paper explores the opportunities and challenges of the \"learned\" OS approach and makes recommendation for future researchers and practitioners on building such an OS.",
  "tldr": "The paper advocates for a shift in operating system development by integrating AI and machine learning to create \"learned\" OSes. It discusses the potential benefits and challenges of this approach, offering recommendations for future research and practical implementation."
