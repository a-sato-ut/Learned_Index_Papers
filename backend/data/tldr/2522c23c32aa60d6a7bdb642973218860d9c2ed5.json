  "title": "SOSD: A Benchmark for Learned Indexes",
  "abstract": "A groundswell of recent work has focused on improving data management systems with learned components. Specifically, work on learned index structures has proposed replacing traditional index structures, such as B-trees, with learned models. Given the decades of research committed to improving index structures, there is significant skepticism about whether learned indexes actually outperform state-of-the-art implementations of traditional structures on real-world data. To answer this question, we propose a new benchmarking framework that comes with a variety of real-world datasets and baseline implementations to compare against. We also show preliminary results for selected index structures, and find that learned models indeed often outperform state-of-the-art implementations, and are therefore a promising direction for future research.",
  "tldr": "The paper introduces SOSD, a benchmarking framework for evaluating learned index structures against traditional ones like B-trees. Preliminary results indicate that learned indexes often outperform state-of-the-art implementations, suggesting they are a promising research avenue."
