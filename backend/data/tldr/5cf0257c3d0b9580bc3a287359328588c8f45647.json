  "title": "Machine learning and high dimensional vector search",
  "abstract": "Machine learning and vector search are two research topics that developed in parallel in nearby communities. However, unlike many other fields related to big data, machine learning has not significantly impacted vector search. In this opinion paper we attempt to explain this oddity. Along the way, we wander over the numerous bridges between the two fields.",
  "tldr": "This opinion paper explores the disconnect between machine learning and vector search, two parallel research areas. It discusses why machine learning has not significantly influenced vector search and highlights the connections and potential synergies between the two fields."
