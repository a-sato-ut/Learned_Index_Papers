  "title": "Vector Databases and Vector Embeddings-Review",
  "abstract": "This research paper aims to present a comprehensive survey of vector databases and vector embedding techniques. A concise overview of the evolution, architecture, advantages and challenges of vector databases are presented in this paper. To convert unstructured data into vectors, various embedding techniques with their in-depth technical description are also surveyed in this research paper. The existing vector databases’ characteristics and features are described to select an appropriate vector database. The embedding and indexing techniques are thoroughly discussed to help the research community experiment with combining them to develop their application. The challenges of vector databases, like selecting distance metrics, dimensionality, data integrity, cost, etc. are presented. This information on vector database systems will help researchers to exhibit further advancements in their data science applications.",
