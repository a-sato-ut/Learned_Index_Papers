  "title": "On Tradeoffs in Learning-Augmented Algorithms",
  "abstract": "The field of learning-augmented algorithms has gained significant attention in recent years. These algorithms, using potentially inaccurate predictions, must exhibit three key properties: consistency, robustness, and smoothness. In scenarios where distributional information about predictions is available, a strong expected performance is required. Typically, the design of these algorithms involves a natural tradeoff between consistency and robustness, and previous works aimed to achieve Pareto-optimal tradeoffs for specific problems. However, in some settings, this comes at the expense of smoothness. This paper demonstrates that certain problems involve multiple tradeoffs between consistency, robustness, smoothness, and average performance.",
  "tldr": "This paper explores tradeoffs in learning-augmented algorithms, highlighting the need for consistency, robustness, and smoothness. It reveals that achieving optimal performance often requires balancing these properties, with some scenarios leading to compromises in smoothness."
