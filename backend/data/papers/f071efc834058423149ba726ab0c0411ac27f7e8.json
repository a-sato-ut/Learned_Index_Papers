    "abstract": "The research area of data summarization seeks to find small data structures that can be updated flexibly, and answer certain queries on the input accurately. Summaries are widely used across the area of data management, and are studied from both theoretical and practical perspectives. They are the subject of ongoing research to improve their performance and broaden their applicability. In this column, recent developments in data summarization are surveyed, with the intent of inspiring further advances.",
