    "abstract": "Key-value lookup functions have been widely applied to network applications, including FIBs, load balancers, and content distributions. Two key performance requirements of a lookup algorithm are high throughput and small memory cost. One limitation of existing fast network lookup algorithms is that they require multiple independent and uniform hash functions, which cost high computation time and might not be available on existing hardware network devices. Recently developed learned model hashing (LMH) proposes to use a linear machine learning model to replace hash functions to avoid hash computation, but they are not optimized for memory cost. We propose a novel network lookup method called Parrot hashing, which uses a learned model to distribute keys into different buckets and applies a simple perfect hashing method to resolve the collisions of the keys in a bucket. Parrot can be implemented with only one CRC8, which is available on all network devices. We implement Parrot in three prototypes: a software program on end hosts, a software switch, and a FIB running on a hardware programmable switch. The experimental results show that Parrot achieves the highest lookup throughput on all three prototypes, compared to existing methods. Its memory cost is also significantly lower than that of LMH.",
