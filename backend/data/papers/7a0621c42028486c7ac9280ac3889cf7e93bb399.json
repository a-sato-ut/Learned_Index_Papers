    "abstract": "Conventional indexing and hashing solutions become ineffective to provide efficient storage and fast retrieval for Big Data due to challenging characteristics of Big Data. Thus, an effective method for Big Data indexing and hashing is required with optimized construction time, storage space, training time, query response time and query result accuracy. Existing Big Data indexing techniques are categorized as Non-Artificial Intelligent, Artificial Intelligent and Collaborative Artificial Intelligent indexing whereas Big Data hashing techniques are categorized as non-deterministic and deterministic hashing. This paper provides an extensive survey on widely used Big Data indexing and hashing techniques along with their parametric comparisons based upon various identified parameters",
