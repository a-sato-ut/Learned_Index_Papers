    "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel learned index called DTtree that can optimize both read and write performance. DTtree adopts two novel designs. (1) To improve write performance, DTtree uses a dynamic filling rate and overflow buffers for each leaf node. The filling rate of a leaf node is dynamically determined according to the read/write tendency of the leaf node so as to improve space efficiency and reduce structure modification operations. In addition, DTtree uses an overflow buffer for a line in each leaf node. The overflow buffer is also dynamically allocated, and only write-intensive leaf nodes may have overflow buffers, reducing unnecessary space costs. (2) To improve read performance, we propose an in-node hot cache to cache hot records within a line of a leaf node, reducing additional memory access to the overflow buffer. As skewed access is common in real-world applications, using in-node hot caches can efficiently improve the read performance of DTtree. We experimentally evaluate DTtree on three datasets. The results on various workloads show that DTtree can reduce SMO operations effectively and achieve higher read/write performance than B+-tree and two representative learned indexes, PGM-Index and ALEX.",
