    "abstract": "As the Moore's Law is ending, and increasingly high demand of software development continues in the human society, we are facing two serious challenges in the computing field. First, the general-purpose computing ecosystem that has been developed for more than 50 years will have to be changed by including many diverse devices for various specialties in high performance. Second, human-based software development is not sustainable to respond the requests from all the fields in the society. We envision that we will enter a time of developing high quality software by machines, and we name this as Software-defined Software (SDS). In this paper, we will elaborate our vision, the goals and its roadmap.",
