    "abstract": "LSM-tree-based key-value stores are popular in embedded storage systems. With the growing demands of data analysis, the secondary index is created to support non-primary-key lookups. However, the lookup efficiency and space consumption of secondary index remain for further optimization. Inspired by the learned index, this paper presents Lark, a learned secondary index toward LSM-tree for resource-constrained embedded storage systems. Lark employs machine learning to speed up the non-primary-key queries and compress secondary indexes. Our preliminary evaluations show that, in comparison with traditional secondary index schemes, Lark achieves better lookup performance with less space consumption.",
