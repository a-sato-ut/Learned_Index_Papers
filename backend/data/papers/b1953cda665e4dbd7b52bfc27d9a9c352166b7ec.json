    "abstract": "With the rapid development of GPU (graphics processing unit) technologies and neural networks, we can explore more appropriate data structures and algorithms. Recent progress shows that neural networks can partly replace traditional data structures. In this paper, we proposed a novel DNN (deep neural network)-based learned locality-sensitive hashing, called LLSH, to efficiently and flexibly map high-dimensional data to low-dimensional space. LLSH replaces the traditional LSH (locality-sensitive hashing) function families with parallel multi-layer neural networks, which reduces the time and memory consumption and guarantees query accuracy simultaneously. The proposed LLSH demonstrate the feasibility of replacing the hash index with learning-based neural networks and open a new door for developers to design and configure data organization more accurately to improve information-searching performance. Extensive experiments on different types of data sets show the superiority of the proposed method in query accuracy, time consumption, and memory usage.",
